                <p>I came to Sault Ste. Marie to study Law and Justice at Algoma University. I chose Algoma University because it was the most financially feasible at the time even though I could have gone to any of the other schools that I applied to. After finishing my law degree I spent some time job hunting and began learning how to code in my free time. It didn’t take long for me to realize that programming was what I really enjoyed and so off I went back to Algoma University for a second degree.</p>

                <p>Lucky for me, Algoma University has a Computer Science Acceleration program for those of us who already have degrees so instead of going back for another gruesome 3 years, I was given the chance to get an equivalent degree in just a year. That’s what I am working on now!</p>

                <p>I’m initially from Niagara Falls On, where I lived until around 2008. In 2008 my family moved to Matheson On. If you don’t know where that is, do not worry, you are not alone. The small township consisting of Ramor, Matheson and Val Gagne has a population 2,400 people spread across all its hamlets. I think out of the three towns I have live in, Sault Ste Marie is my favorite because it is not too big like Niagara, and not too small like Matheson- it’s juuuust right.</p>

                <p>In my free time I like to play video games, code, watch Star Trek, cook/bake, draw, and make crafts! I’m fairly outgoing and some people might call me a “social butterfly”. Currently I also spend some of my free time running the Algoma Computer Science Club! The club focuses on socializing and encouraging the Computer Science students to work on developing their technological skills. We throw events such as game jams, pub nights, and tutorials to show students how to use various development tools such as Git Hub and Unity. I think it is important to encourage students to interact with each other and to work on personal projects.</p>

                <p>One thing I wish I could do is to integrate computer programming into grade schools and high schools. Technology has become a prominent part of our everyday life and it is important not only to know how to use it but also to understand how it works! I think that if we encourage students at a young age to begin programming they will realize that it is something feasible for them to work towards. The more impassioned people in the field of Computer Science means the more crucial technological advancements will develop over a span of time. Advancement in technology means advancement in things like space exploration, medical technology, and even an advancement in the betterment of human lives.</p>
