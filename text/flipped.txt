Izabelle walked steadily up to the massive oak doors of the church and lifted her hand to the solid ring handle. &ldquo;How dare they not already have the doors open, waiting for us,&rdquo; she said in a low tone, not turning to look at her soon-to-be husband who stood behind her at the bottom of the church steps. Just then the door cracked open and a wispy haired woman stuck her head out, forcing a smile. </p>

<p> &ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be too much longer, our maid is still at it,&rdquo; she muttered briskly, quickly popping her head back into the church, closing the door behind her. </p>

<p> &ldquo;This is just awful, just because we don&rsquo;t have guests does not mean we should have to wait to be wed,&rdquo; Izabelle sighed, now turning on her heal to face James with a slight pout. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Not to worry love, we will be married on time, and then we can go home and lie in the sun together, or go for a walk with the horses,&rdquo; James replied in a comforting tone. </p>

<p> Izabelle stepped daintily down the steps and gave James a sly look. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Well at this point I don&rsquo;t care if the hall is dirty, it could be run red with blood and I would still just be happy to be married by noon. She had better hurry, by the look of the sun she can&rsquo;t have more than a minute till ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Izabelle reached the bottom of the steps and brushed against James&rsquo; chest, stepping up on her toes to kiss him lightly before walking past him into a spot of sun which slipped between tangles of leaves above her. The church was perfect, secluded, and beautiful, but the prospect of being married in the late hours of the day made Izabelle&rsquo;s skin crawl. It is bad luck, she thought, only lazy women get married past mid-day and even ten is practically brunch time. </p>

<p>The sound of a deep thud behind her made her spin around to see that James had gone into the church while she had been basking in the sun. The corner of Izabelle&rsquo;s lips raised on one side and she let out a soft, triumphant chuckle. She knew he would catch her hint, and he would do anything to make her happy&mdash;that was what she liked about him. Nothing would get in the way of their love, not her parents, not the town, and definitely not some sloth-like maid who couldn&rsquo;t get her job done on time. <br />
 A sharp scream rang from the church, reverberating off the forest surrounding her. Izabelle looked back up through the trees with glee. Not a moment later, James had exited the church and was propping the oak door open, looking contentedly at Izabelle as she turned towards him and began to walk gracefully up the church steps. As they entered the church the sound of a grandfather clock began to ring: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten. <br />
