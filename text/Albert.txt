<p>Jasmine leaped onto the back of a slowly passing logging truck, grabbing the ropes around the logs for support, and wedging herself into a comfortable position on one of the logs. If it weren&rsquo;t for the menacing weather that was blowing in, she wouldn&rsquo;t have been so eager to leave New York, especially not on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>There was always something to eat in New York. something to grab off of a hot dog cart while she passed, or a store that was too full of people for her to be caught treating herself to the five-finger discount, but she couldn&rsquo;t stay longer.  It was already the beginning of December and she was lucky that New York hadn&rsquo;t been hit by a major snowstorm yet, but with the look of the clouds coming in, she knew that she must get out of New York now, as much as she regretted having to. After all, it was only a day&rsquo;s drive to Florida, and traveling for a few hours was much more preferable than freezing to death just before the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think mum will realize I&rsquo;m gone?&rdquo; Jasmine asked, holding up a ragged looking teddy bear, torn from years of Jasmines love. The bear stared back at her with saddened eyes. Of course her mom wouldn&rsquo;t notice, her mom hadn&rsquo;t cared when Jasmine ran away, she didn&rsquo;t even going looking for her. After 11 months of waiting for her mother to finally come find her, Jasmine had lost all hope of ever returning home, let alone to a loving one. </p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Albert, if mum weren&rsquo;t so mean, I would have just walked back home today instead of all this. I&rsquo;m stubborn but not that much.&rdquo; Albert, Jasmines bear, continued to stare back as if he didn&rsquo;t think Jasmines plan to travel to Florida was that great of an idea. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Albert, I know you miss home, I do too, but you know if I go back she will just throw you into the fire like she did with Timmy and Doe, and remember your friend Ducky?&rdquo; Jasmine continued to ramble on about the different tortures she would be missing out on by not returning home. </p>

<p>&ldquo;You know she doesn&rsquo;t even miss me, ever since daddy left she hasn&rsquo;t been much of a mum, its okay though Albert, we have each other!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasmine liked to believe that it was her enthusiasm and her flamboyant personality that kept her from giving in to her cruel surroundings. Although it was always good to look on the bright side of things, she didn&rsquo;t think there was any to returning home. For all she knew, her mom might not even accept her plea to come back, and Jasmine would continue life on her own, so what was the point? </p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, according to mum, I&rsquo;m just a mistake, and nobody likes mistakes! Even when you try and erase them, those silly pencil lines are still there, and there is just no way to get rid of it!&rdquo; Jasmine bickered, tucking Albert between the rope and a log so that he wouldn&rsquo;t fall off the truck. </p>

<p> As the truck turned onto the highway, they began to speed up and Jasmine crawled her way into a more supportive position, trying to keep herself from the same misfortune she was keeping Albert from. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well Albert, I suppose your hungry too, huh? It&rsquo;s all right though, we will be in Florida soon and there will be orange trees to eat from! Maybe we will treat ourselves to a nice supper at a restaurant too, hm? What do you say Albert?&rdquo; Jasmine dug into the tearing pocket of her jeans and pulled out a few pennies and nickels that she had found lying around on the streets of New York. </p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have much but&#8230;&rdquo; Almost as though it was in slow motion, Jasmine watched as Albert slipped through the shuddering ropes that bound the logs to the truck, and flew down the road. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Albert, no, please come back!&rdquo; Jasmine cried, pushing at the log she had wedged herself under and trying to get herself free. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Albert!&rdquo; By the time Jasmine had freed herself from the ropes and motioned to leap off the truck, Albert was nowhere in site. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Albert, come back,&rdquo; she whispered again, hanging off the back of the logger and holding on with one hand for support. </p>

<p>Jasmine continued to hang off of the truck, whimpering and trying to calculate her chances of success if she jumped off and ran back to find Albert. Maybe if she jumped now? It wouldn&rsquo;t take too long to find a new truck to jump on, and Albert couldn&rsquo;t be that hard to find. But what did she know? She was only a 7-year-old girl with no chance of surviving the jump off the truck. Accepting Albert&rsquo;s fate, Jasmine tucked herself back into her previous position and began to whimper, slowly falling into a deep, sweet dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running. Running through the streets and laughing, laughing with you Albert! You&rsquo;re back in my arms, and I&rsquo;m swinging you around and around in circles. There are other kids too Albert! And they&rsquo;re laughing too. We are all so happy, and we love each other. There are just two boys and another girl; they call me sister! It feels so good to be called family. A kind woman walked out of the house and hollered our names, and when we got inside, she gave us lemonade, Albert! With popsicles! She gave me a banana one, that&rsquo;s my favorite! Did you ever think I would have a favorite popsicle, Albert? She gave you some cookies. She told me that a popsicle would be too messy for you, but you wanna know the best part Albert? She told me to call her mom!</p>

<p> When me and my sisters and brothers went back outside, a tall man followed us and started squirting me with a water gun. Do you know what a water gun is, Albert? It&rsquo;s like a real gun but when you shoot it, it shoots out water and the gun is really colourful! My sister Jenna laughed and said that I could call the man dad, and he told me to also&#8230; so now I call him dad, Albert, and we play with him every day! Except for when he&rsquo;s at work, then I get to help mom bake cookies! Isn&rsquo;t it great Albert? </p>

<p>When Jasmine awoke, the sun was beginning to rise and the truck had come to a stop in a large parking lot. &ldquo;Wow, I slept the rest of the morning and all night!&rdquo; Jasmine said out loud, turning around to grab Albert from his sleeping spot. After a few minutes of searching in a sleepy stance, Jasmine remembered the events of the previous night and slowly began to crawl off the back of the logging truck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Albert,&rdquo; Jasmine sighed, looking back towards the direction she thought she had lost Albert in. Slowly, she began to walk towards the now bustling city that expanded, never ending, on the rode in front of her. </p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll, it&rsquo;s awfully quiet here with no Albert, I think I&rsquo;ll have to make a new friend,&rdquo; Jasmine inquired as she passed some streetlights and a corner store. Her stomach growled in an aching roar as she watched people rush out of the stores and restaurants carrying coffees and donuts, and Jasmine began to wonder where she should stop to eat. Continuing to pace up the street, it finally occurred to Jasmine what she would do. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; She chirped taking her pennies back out of her pocket. Jasmine raced down the street, looking left and right to find the place she was looking for, but instead, found countless men and women hustling up the street, and storeowners flipping closed signs to open. Finally, she came across a beautiful park. The park was empty of any human life, and stretched across for some miles until the grass finally changed to a narrow road, then to sand and finally, to a vast expanse of water. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; She cried, racing to the beach and squishing her toes in the sand. The sun beat down on her in a sweet and calming heat, making her relax and crave the sparkling blue water. Slowly, Jasmine slid up to the waterfront and let the water lap at her toes, tickling her feet and washing the dirt from her skin. </p>

<p>&ldquo;What a mess! This will never do!&rdquo; Jasmine scoffed as she watched her reflection in the water. Jasmines had a heart shaped face with almond shaped eyes and long brown hair that flowed down to the middle of her back. Her eyes were an odd green color, with specks of brown and gold scattered throughout her iris and she had butterfly lips that spread across her face in a wide grin. She noticed that when she smiled, she had a dimple on each cheek; adding to her smile and making her look genuinely pretty. Her dad always told her that she had dimples because she smiled so much, and she was beautiful because she was given it as a reward of her good heart, but she never believed him. </p>

<p>Dipping her hands into the water, Jasmine grabbed some and brought it to her face, wiping streaks of dirt off her face and making herself look like a pair of striped pajamas. Jasmine giggled and wiped the rest of the dirt off of her face, cleaning her arms and stripping off her soiled clothes, down to her underwear, to wash her legs and torso. After a few sips of water, she began to slowly wash her jeans and her once white blouse, scrubbing at the stains and watching as the dirt from her clothes dyed the water a foggy brown. </p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jasmine sighed, laying her clothes on the fence that surrounded the beach, and letting the sun drink up the water, &ldquo;almost ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasmine walked back to the water and dipped her head all the way under, wetting her hair. Then, coming back up, she slowly twisted her hair to release the dirty water, and then put her head under again. Jasmine did this a few times before finally, the water straining out of her hair was no longer brown, but a clear, drinkable liquid that fell as though it were a water fall. Jasmine combed through her hair with her fingers, then dipped her hands into the water one final time, lifting up a handful of dirt, shells and one, small, lonely rock. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jasmine cried in shock, dropping everything out of her hand but the rock, &ldquo;well aren&rsquo;t you pretty and lonely, you&rsquo;re kind of like me!&rdquo; Jasmine sang, watching as her imagination slowly turned the rock into the form of an animal, with two large eyes and stubby feet that stuck out the side of it. The rock looked as though it were almost smiling, relieved to be out of the water that had been lapping over it for so long. Slowly, Jasmine&rsquo;s imagination picked out the animal&rsquo;s tail that was so neatly curled around its back, with one loan spike that protruded out of the top of its head like the horn of a unicorn.</p>

<p>Jasmine stared at the rock for a few more minutes as her imagination added colours and animal&rsquo;s noises to her new found friend. She curled her fingers around it, pushing the rock into the middle of her palm and encasing it in a small, protective shell. </p>

<p>The wind brushed against Jasmine&rsquo;s cheeks as she skipped her way back over to where the sun had almost completely dried her clothes for her. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well Jack, that will be your name; Jack, we are going out for supper tonight. I promised Albert I would take him someplace lovely, but&#8230;&rdquo; Jasmine paused and looked up at the sky, smiling as the sun warmed her lips and dried her hair, warming the back of her neck as she shimmied back into her jeans and blouse. </p>

<p>Once she was finally dressed in her freshly cleaned clothes, Jasmine looked almost the same as she did when she had first run away from home. The only differences were the cuts and bruises that her mother had given her that were now completely healed, as well as her matured look.</p>

<p> When Jasmine had left home, she was only six. She turned seven a few months later, earning her an ice cream cone from the parlor in New York. But, Despite her age difference, her chubby cheeks, arms and body had now shrunken to her bones, making her look taller and more mature. Jasmine had since also grown in bust size and her face had squared off from her once round shaped face, to her now almond shaped one. And yet, despite her change in maturity, she definitely still felt like a kid. Not only because of her lack of education (as she didn&rsquo;t dare return to her school once she had run away, the teachers would most definitely make sure she was brought home) but also because of her energetic and child-like imagination. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, What do you say Jack? Shall we go and find someplace nice to eat?&rdquo; Jasmine giggled, smoothing down her blouse and beginning to walk back across the green park.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Jasmine and Jack to find a beautiful restaurant after they had left the park. Jasmine stood in front of a towering, burgundy; brick building that bore a massive, cursive sign that read; now serving lunch. The building had darkly tinted windows and burgundy curtains that were tied back, in front of them, adding to the Italian essence that the restaurant seemed to give off. Stepping inside, Jasmine breathed in the sweat sent of pasta and wine as couples and families huddled around tables in hushed conversations. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; A young woman asked, pushing her blond bangs out of her face and standing up straight. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would like a table for&#8230;&rdquo; Jasmine paused and grasped Jack ever more tightly in the palm of her hand, &ldquo;for two please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will someone be joining you?&rdquo; The woman responded in a light tone, seeming to size up Jasmine. Jasmine sucked in a deep breath of air, hoping that the woman wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell her actual age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, er&#8230;my boyfriend,&rdquo; Jasmine answered, listening as she choked out the words in a high-pitched squeal. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, right this way,&rdquo; the woman finally said, brightening her appearance with a wide smile. </p>

<p>Jasmine followed the woman through the restaurant and was sat down at a small, oak table, with two tall chairs that sat like a thrown on either end of the table. After placing a menu on the table, the woman gracefully walked away and stopped a few tables away at another couple. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well Jack, isn&rsquo;t this nice?&rdquo; Jasmine laughed again, sitting down onto the fluffy, burgundy cushions that sat on the chairs.</p>

<p>Jasmine opened her palm and stared at Jack&rsquo;s passive expression.  &ldquo;Well, what would you like for lunch Jack?&rdquo; she inquired, flipping open her menu and reading through the various pasta and Italian dishes.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Look at all these different spaghetti dishes! Oh and they have pizza, and lasagna!&rdquo; Jasmine said joyfully, placed Jack on the table beside her silver plate, and tucked him underneath the red cloth placemat so that the waitress wouldn&rsquo;t see him. Jasmine could just see the woman&rsquo;s face now, spotting Jack&rsquo;s smooth body lying motionless on the table. She would, without a doubt, rip poor Jack off the table and throw him outside, probably with some disgusted words to add to her disapproval. </p>

<p> &ldquo;And garlic bread! Oh, I used to love daddy&rsquo;s garlic bread!&rdquo; She continued, reading through the three-page menu and making comments on almost every dish.</p>

<p> &ldquo;What do you think &ldquo;feta&rdquo; is Jack? And what kind of a drink is a strawberry daiquiri? Why is it on the menu twice? Ah, I see, ones virgin.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Are you ready to order, or are you going to wait for your date?&rdquo; The blond woman asked, snapping Jasmine out of her thoughts. Jasmine hadn&rsquo;t even realized the woman had come back and began to wonder how long the waitress had been standing there. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Uhm, I&rsquo;ll order for him,&rdquo; Jasmine said, trying to keep the quiver of fear out of her voice. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Alright, then what can I get for you miss?&rdquo;  Jasmine stared at the menu and quickly put together a delicious meal in her head. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Uhm, I think I&rsquo;ll have some lasagna, with garlic bread and a glass of&#8230;water&rdquo; Jasmine said, reading through the list of drinks, unsure of which one to choose, let alone of which ones she could even drink without feeling funny afterwards. </p>

<p> &ldquo;And for your date?&rdquo; The waitress asked as she finished writing down Jasmines order. Jasmine hesitated. She had no Idea what kind of food Jack would eat; she didn&rsquo;t even really know what kind of creature he was. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Uhm, Just get him a &#8230;Chicken Caesar Salad for now, I&rsquo;m sure he will order more food when he&rsquo;s done it.&rdquo; Jasmine answered, deciding to just get more food for herself. </p>

<p> &ldquo;And does he want something to drink?&rdquo; The waitress continued to press.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll order one when he comes in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasmine watched as the waitress wrote down Jack&rsquo;s order and strode off into the restaurant&rsquo;s kitchen. </p>

<p> &ldquo;I hope a salad is okay, It comes with some meat for you, incase you&rsquo;re a carnivore,&rdquo; Jasmine whispered, lifting up her placemat to look at Jack. </p>

<p> By the time her meal came, there was only one more couple in the restaurant; happily sitting at the table across from her and sipping wine glasses.   &ldquo;And we can name her Isabelle!&rdquo; Jasmine heard the woman say to the man, in an excited tone. The man laughed in a husky voice and grabbed the woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Why Isabelle?&rdquo; He laughed again, taking a sip of wine.  &ldquo;Well, because it&rsquo;s such a pretty name&rdquo; The woman replied happily.  &ldquo;Why not rose, or violet, those are pretty names, right?&rdquo;   &ldquo;Well, yes but that&rsquo;s because they are pretty flowers, not because the name sounds nice.&rdquo; The woman said, sounded genuinely happy as she talked to the man. Jasmine wished that she had a name like Isabelle so she could be wanted as much as the couple wanted an Isabelle.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well what about Bethany, or trinity, or maybe hope?&rdquo; The man continued, counting names on his fingers.  &ldquo;Oh, I know! What about&#8230; Jasmine?&rdquo; The woman sang.  Jasmine&rsquo;s jaw dropped and she wiped her head around to look at the couple more straight on, but neither noticed and Jasmine turned back to her untouched meal with a grin.  &ldquo;Jack, it looks spectacular!&rdquo; She gasped; admiring the parsley that lined the plates and the neatly organized food. Jasmine picked up her fork and took her first bite, sighing with complete pleasure.  &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s delicious!&rdquo; She whispered, taking a bite of garlic bread making her mouth water and her stomach leaped with joy.  Jasmine finished her dish, commenting on the different tastes throughout the meal.  &ldquo;Has your date showed up yet?&rdquo; The waitress asked, walking over to the table and staring at the untouched salad and then at Jasmine&rsquo;s empty plate.  &ldquo;No&#8230; I&#8230;&rdquo; Jasmine tried to sound upset as the waitress looked at her with sympathy. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll just get some chocolate fondue cake and see if he shows up?&rdquo; Jasmine whispered, handing the waitress her plate and watching her walk away again. As soon as the waitress was out of sight, Jasmine stood up and walked towards the door, trying not to rush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t paid for your meal yet miss,&rdquo; A man said from behind her, grabbing her arm lightly and pulling her back through the open door Jasmine was about to walk through. Jasmine turned around and saw the man who had been sitting at the table across from her. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; Jasmine lied, pulling her arm back and letting it rest at her side.  &ldquo;No you didn&rsquo;t, you ordered some cake and said your date would be here soon.&rdquo; He replied as he discreetly stepped between Jasmine and the door. Jasmine began to panic and stepped back, further into the restaurant. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just looking for the bathroom,&rdquo; she said, turning her lie around to sound more genuine. The man looked at Jasmine as if he knew the truth, and pointed her the opposite way of the door. &ldquo;The bathroom is at that end of the restaurant.&rdquo; He said, smiling sweetly and patting her on the back. Slowly, Jasmine walked towards the bathroom, praying that there would be a window she could escape out of, but of course, there wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Jasmine walked through the door and was surrounded by the overwhelming smell of vanilla air freshener and hand soap. The bathroom had just two stalls, with burgundy doors and a marble top counter where the sink was. Of course, despite the beautiful look of the washroom, and the comfort of the tiled floor on Jasmine&rsquo;s sandaled feet, there was no sign of any escape. No emergency exit, no vent, no extra door and not one hint of a window. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Jack, what&#8230;&rdquo; Jasmine felt like crying as she remembered that Jack was still at her table, hidden underneath her placemat. Now there was no escape and she had no friend. Even if there had been an escape in the washroom, she couldn&rsquo;t just leave without Jack. </p>

<p>Jasmine slowly walked back out of the bathroom and back to her table where a delicately placed desert plate was sitting on her side of the table. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even be excited about this stupid thing.&rdquo; Jasmine moaned, taking Jack out from his hiding spot and tucking him back into the palm of her hand. Jasmine noticed that the man was still sitting at the table across from her, while the woman stood, speaking to the waitress. </p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m being ratted on,&rdquo; Jasmine cried out, wishing she wouldn&rsquo;t have lost Albert, and wishing she would have just stayed in New York. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe mum actually did come looking for me, and just couldn&rsquo;t find me!&rdquo; Jasmine hoped, secretly knowing that it wasn&rsquo;t true. She didn&rsquo;t travel far from home when she left, well, at least not till now, and it wouldn&rsquo;t have been hard to find her if the seeker actually wanted to find her. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss, I don&rsquo;t think your date is going to show up,&rdquo; The waitress said, returning to Jasmines table and removing the cake from her presence.  &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t finished that yet,&rdquo; Jasmine whispered back, knowing full well that the waitress didn&rsquo;t care.  &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m going to have to ask you for your ID,&rdquo; the waitress continued in an inpatient tone. Jasmine stared up at the woman and shook her head.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only 7, I don&rsquo;t have ID,&rdquo; She replied, placing Jack back on the table and spinning him like a top.  &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m sorry ma&rsquo;am; I&rsquo;m going to have to ask you to pay for your meal and leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jasmine reached deep into her pocket and pulled out the few coins that she had, placing them on the table, &ldquo;how much do I owe you?&rdquo; She asked, shaking her head in shame. The waitress handed Jasmine a bill. &ldquo;Fifty-six dollars?&rdquo; Jasmine almost screamed, tears beginning to run down her face. She started to count her coins, struggling under the stare of the waitress and shaking as she pushed the pennies into her palm. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty five,&rdquo; she coughed, tears beginning to run down her face. Jasmine closed her fingers around the last coin as it dropped into her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhm,&rdquo; she moaned, swallowing the overwhelming sense of nausea that was beginning to engulf her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little bit short.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waitress looked at Jasmine with frustration and disapproval, &ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;ll have to wait for your date to show up then, now wont you?&rdquo; The waitress scoffed, taking a phone out of her apron pocket, &ldquo;Call someone to bail you out, and make it quick.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Jasmine slowly reached out her arm and slid the phone out of the waitress&rsquo;s hand, staring at it as though it were some kind of monster. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do I call?&rdquo; She sobbed, shaking violently as she clenched her fist around Jack. Jasmine wished that Jack were Albert, who else knew her like Albert did?</p>

<p>Albert knew everything about Jasmine, everything about her parents and her life. He knew why Jasmine was in the situation she was in now, he knew how kind and good she really was, and how strong she was, but Jack? Jack knew nothing about her, it would just take to long to explain everything to him, and she didn&rsquo;t have the time for that when she did need to talk to him. By the time she would have told Jack everything, she wouldn&rsquo;t have remembered what she wanted to make a reference to in the first place. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I know,&rdquo; The waitress mocked, throwing her hands out and almost throwing the cake that was still in her hand, &ldquo;call your date!&rdquo; she laughed.  Jasmine looked at the waitress in loss and tossed the money she had, back onto the table.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a date, this is my date,&rdquo; Jasmine said venomously, opening her palm to reveal Jack to the waitress. The waitress took Jack out of Jasmines palm and laughed. &ldquo;Well, shows how insignificant you are, what about your parents? Call your dad, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll get a kick out of this!&rdquo; The waitress continued to drone, filling her voice and actions with venom.  &ldquo;My dad&rsquo;s dead. And my mom lives in New York.&rdquo; Jasmine barked, wanting to hurt the waitress with her words. The waitress stood, still smiling darkly with no change despite Jasmines comment. &ldquo;Well, good thing this phone has free long distance!&rdquo; She said, pointing at the phone and raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her for almost a year,&rdquo; Jasmine pressed, trying to gain some sympathy and be released.  &ldquo;Well, now would be a nice day to start seeing her again, hu?&rdquo; the waitress grinned. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, she won&rsquo;t help me anyways.&rdquo; </p>

<p>The couple that Jasmine had been sitting next to stood staring at Jasmine and the waitress with worried glances, whispering in undertones to each other as the waitress continued to mock and scorn Jasmine.   &ldquo;Well, you better hope she does otherwise you're going to have some issues kid,&rdquo; The waitress growled making her seem almost heartless.  &ldquo;I ran away,&rdquo; Jasmine whimpered.  &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s your own problem, not mine.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay&#8230;I just,&rdquo; Before Jasmine could say anymore, the man stepped in front of the waitress and slammed a 10 and a 20 on the table, glaring at the waitress as if she were some kind of demon.   &ldquo;Take the other 25 dollars off of the tip we gave you,&rdquo; The man said, growling a curse under his breath.   &ldquo;No, let her pay for her own meal!&rdquo; The waitress screeched, shoving the coins and bills off of the table.   &ldquo;You told her to get someone to bail her out, we will bail her out!&rdquo; The man boomed back, snatching Jack back out of the waitress&rsquo;s hand.   &ldquo;She has issues with her mother, let her deal with them and her mom can pay for it from her own pocket,&rdquo; The waitress snapped, slamming the chocolate cake back in front of Jasmine in anger. The man placed Jack carefully back into Jasmines open palm and smiled weakly, turning back to the waitress in anger.   &ldquo;If she has issues at home, it&rsquo;s not your place to judge her for it,&rdquo; He whispered in a deep voice.   &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a rebellious pre-teen and doesn&rsquo;t deserve to get away with this!&rdquo; The waitress screamed back, raising her voice with every word. Just then, a man stepped out of the kitchen, covered in food, looking disgruntled.   &ldquo;What is going on in her Stella?&rdquo; The kitchen man yelled, referring to the waitress in an annoyed tone.  &ldquo;My mommy hit me, and burned Ducky in the stove!&rdquo; Jasmine finally screamed at Stella, defending herself against being called a &ldquo;rebellious pre-teen&rdquo;.  Both the man and woman that had sat near Jasmine gaped at Jasmine with dropped Jaws while the kitchen man stood where he was, looking shocked and confused at the same time.   &ldquo;Stella, what is going on?&rdquo; He said again, now that the restaurant was silent again.  &ldquo;She needs to pay for her meal, Jason,&rdquo; Stella answered quietly.  The kitchen man, Jason, stared back at Stella in disgust.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s money on the floor, right at your feet Stella, what is that for?&rdquo; Jason said calmly, walking over and picking up the money delicately. Stella stared at Jason in annoyance and looked at the man and woman for help.  &ldquo;We paid for this young ladies lunch,&rdquo; The woman replied in a twinkling voice.   &ldquo;Is that a problem?&rdquo; Jason asked, turning from the couple, back to Stella.   &ldquo;She&#8230; I&#8230;&rdquo; Stella stuttered in annoyance, taking the money out of Jason&rsquo;s hand and tucking it into her apron pocket. Jason huffed in approval then went to return to the kitchen.  &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Jasmine whispered as Jason turned back and smiled at her with sparkling eyes.  &ldquo;Good luck kid,&rdquo; He said in a deep voice as he returned to the kitchen.  Jasmine stood up and wrapped her hand around her neck nervously, hanging her head low in embarrassment.   &ldquo;I&#8230; how can I repay you? I don&rsquo;t have any money, well&#8230; I guess I have thirty five cents but I&#8230;&rdquo; Jasmine rambled as the waitress stocked off in annoyance, serving a new customer who was just walking in through the door.   &ldquo;Well, we definitely can&rsquo;t just let you get away with this young lady,&rdquo; The man said in a stern voice as the woman laughed heartily. Jasmine looked at them with tired eyes and let out a small whimper.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name young lady?&rdquo; The woman asked, wrapping her arm around the man&rsquo;s waist.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&#8230; It&rsquo;s Jasmine,&rdquo; She whispered back, watching as both the man and the woman&rsquo;s eyes lit up.   &ldquo;Lilly, She...&rdquo; The man said, turning to the woman.  &ldquo;Yes Charles, I know&#8230; Well, since I can&rsquo;t conceive, we were just going to adopt a little girl anyways, and this would be a little bit less paper work, and we know her a bit, and she&rsquo;s very pretty,&rdquo; The woman rambled, bouncing happily on her heals.   &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 7,&rdquo; Jasmine said, whispering in a voice that made her sound much younger.  Charles looked at Jasmine and laughed, &ldquo;Which means she can already talk and walk, and we won&rsquo;t have to spend all that money on diapers!&rdquo; He laughed enthusiastically. Lilly elbowed Charles in disapproval, making Jasmine laugh. </p>

<p>Jasmines laugh was a beautiful, twinkling sound that echoed around the restaurant like a new, popular song. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well Jasmine, what would you think of being our daughter in repayment for this...ghastly thing you just did?&rdquo; Lilly laughed again, watching as Jasmine looked down at her feet. Jasmine thought of her dream from the previous night. This couple looked exactly like those in her dream. Lilly had bright, green eyes and fire red hair that flipped out in choppy &ldquo;wings&rdquo; just above her shoulders. </p>

<p>She had thousands of freckles all over her face and looked as though she were younger than 20 years old. The man, Charles, was a tall and well-built man with short, blond hair and blue eyes that sparkled and reminded Jasmine of a sunny blue sky. They were both beautiful people, both inside and out, it seemed, and Jasmine couldn&rsquo;t help but think how perfect life would be with them, if only she had Albert. In one swift motion, Jasmine leapt out of her seat, abandoning Jack on the table, and threw her arms around Lilly.   &ldquo;Yes! Please, oh yes!&rdquo; Jasmine cried, pulling back from Lilly&rsquo;s hug and jumping into Charles&rsquo; open arms.   &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; She said again, snuggling into Charles&rsquo; neck.  The next thing Jasmine knew, she was falling asleep in the back of a Jeep, to the deep rumbling of the engine as it brought her to her new home.  Three Weeks Later Jasmine Laughed as Charles chased her to the front door to retrieve the morning&rsquo;s mail; throwing the door open and jumping out before he could catch her and tickle her. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Look dad, there&rsquo;s a box!&rdquo; Jasmine laughed again, picking it up and shaking it. Charles took the box out of Jasmine&rsquo;s hands and looked at it curiously.  &ldquo;Well look at that, it&rsquo;s a present for you!&rdquo; Charles replied, slipping the lid off the box to look at the contents.  &ldquo;Well, would you look at that,&rdquo; He mumbled under his breath, reaching in and poking the contents. &ldquo;Really? Who&rsquo;s it from, who&rsquo;s it from?&rdquo; Jasmine screeched, jumping up and down in excitement. </p>

<p>Charles examined the box and shrugged, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell yea,&rdquo; He smiled, handing her the box and telling her to take it into the house before she opened it.  Jasmine ran through the kitchen and dropped the box on the table, laughing as Lilly turned around and made a silly face at her. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Mom, I got a box!&rdquo; Jasmine chirped as Lilly walked to the table with Charles and sat down. </p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Lilly asked as Jasmine flung the box open. Jasmine&rsquo;s jaw dropped as she pulled a shaggy looking teddy bear out of the package. </p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo; Jasmine whispered, tears welling up in her eyes, &ldquo;its Albert! Mom, Dad, its Albert!&rdquo; She cried, watching as her parents&rsquo; faces grew into wide grins. Jasmine wrapped her arms tightly around the bear her birth father had given to her before he died. &ldquo;I wonder who it&rsquo;s from,&rdquo; Charles whispered as he pulled the box towards himself and lifted out a dirt-covered envelope.  Opening it with a small letter opener, Charles smiled as he read through the contents of the letter. </p>

<p>Dear young girl; I&rsquo;m sorry for your wait; it took me a while to find you. I guess you&rsquo;re wondering how this bear is getting back to you hu? Well, I guess I should tell you that I knew you were sleeping on the back of my truck. I didn&rsquo;t know until I saw this sad bear flying off the back, in my rearview mirror but, it didn&rsquo;t take long for me to guess that you might be there. Although, I couldn&rsquo;t turn back right then, as I had to stay on schedule, I vowed to myself that I would go back for your lost teddy bear. Once I got into Florida, and saw you sleeping in the back, I took my car that I had parked in Florida, and went back for your bear. I found him in a ditch, with a sad look on his face. Although, I did try to get him back to you before you woke up and left, by the time I returned you were gone, and so I went looking for you. I don&rsquo;t know who you are, where you&rsquo;re from or what you were doing out in the wild on your own, but I know one thing for sure. God gave you a purpose in this world and that purpose was to fit into the heart of the family you now live with. Congratulations on your new home darling.  God Bless &ldquo;She&rsquo;s defiantly a little treasure,&rdquo; Lilly smiled as Charles placed the letter down on the table and watched Jasmine run off with Albert. Charles nodded in agreement as they watched Jasmine run off with Albert, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s our little treasure now.&rdquo;   The End</p>
