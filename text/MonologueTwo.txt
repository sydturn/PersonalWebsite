<p>Monologue 2 (Rich Man, Poor Man)</p>

<p>Look at these rags I wear<br />
This tattered Vintage suit!<br />
I am non-but I a poor man<br />
All you who are out to get me<br />
You say I&rsquo;m rich and senseless<br />
I have no feelings just manor, and yet<br />
Look at this watch I wear<br />
18 karat gold? Why that&rsquo;s only 75%! <br />
These shoes of mine are brown, not black!<br />
And this tie of mine might fray!<br />
And every day you people mock me and scowl<br />
You give the money to the rich, those with families<br />
You give the money to those with homes!<br />
And here am I just this courtyard and myself!<br />
I have no family, I have no house, and I have no money<br />
Just a poor man I am, this ring is one diamond, not two<br />
This hair is only groomed and styled once a day<br />
These cloaks are only replaced by the hour<br />
And you give them the money&#8230;<br />
Oh me, oh me, oh me<br />
Dear fellow, Could you spare a dime? <br />
I&rsquo;ve only 10 buckets full<br />
And my maid only washes my clothes!<br />
Washes my clothes but not my hair<br />
Powders my dishes but not my cheeks<br />
She&rsquo;ll warm my food but not the bath water<br />
Pitiful and wasting am I<br />
I have a Looney instead of two dimes!<br />
Now tell me, what is one to two? <br />
I am non-but a poor man, poor man, poor man.<br />
