<p>FLIGHT N611<br />
(Final Short Play)</p>

<p>CHARACTERS<br />
KATIE A 20 year old girl who is very forgetful. She is stuck on an island doing rehab for something she can&rsquo;t recall.</p>

<p>JASON One of Katie&rsquo;s two friends on the island. He is tech savvy and outgoing with a bubbly personality. He believes he is in rehab for drug abuse. </p>

<p>BAILEY One of Katie&rsquo;s friends, she is optimistic and attempts to be a reassurance for Katie. She is also an alcoholic and is sort of a rebel, sneaking stolen alcohol around with her in her water bottle. </p>

<p>JEFF One of the rehab patients. Has very poor short, and long term memory and doesn&rsquo;t even know his own name. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize he has poor memory and is quite cocky.</p>

<p>BRANDON Another one of the rehab patients. He avoids taking his medicine and is therefore treated more aggressively by the rehab workers. He is a bit of a conspiracy theorist and is aggressive by nature. </p>

<p>ASSISTANT Brandon&rsquo;s caretaker tasked with the job of making Brandon submit to blood tests, making sure he takes his medication.</p>

<p>TIME<br />
Late April in the middle of the day, between rehabilitation classes. The present.</p>

ACT I</p>

<p> SCENE 1</p>

<p>(Katie and Bailey are sitting in a coffee shop talking to each other. Katie has notes spread out on the table in front of her. Jeff sits at another table. Brandon is also in the coffee shop at a separate table)</p>

<p>KATIE<br />
I have a bad memory. I often forget why I came to this island, I remember saying goodbye to my family and getting on the plane- Canadian Airlines Flight N611, departing from&#8230; uhm&#8230; well coming here anyways. I mean I know I&rsquo;m here for rehab but I don&rsquo;t remember why&#8230; probably to help me remember things better&#8230; or something. </p>

<p>BAILEY<br />
Oh I&rsquo;m sure your fine. There&rsquo;s lots of people here who have it worse then you&mdash;at least you can remember some things, Jeff over there keeps introducing himself to me as someone else each time we meet. </p>

<p>(Jeff gets up and walks over to Bailey and Katie.)</p>

<p>JEFF<br />
Hi! I&rsquo;m Alex, I saw you looking at me and thought I would introduce myself! Here&rsquo;s my number if you want to hang out sometime, it gets pretty lame here. <br />
 (Hand&rsquo;s Katie a paper and walks out of the shop)<br />
 <br />
 BAILEY<br />
Sure thing. And Brandon over there is in denial. He keeps saying he is supposed to be in England visiting his cousins. </p>

<p> (Assistant enters and walks over to Brandon&rsquo;s table)</p>

<p> ASSISTANT<br />
It&rsquo;s time for your blood test Brandon.</p>

<p> BRANDON<br />
 (Aggressively)<br />
No, this is ridiculous, I want a lawyer. </p>

<p> ASSISTANT<br />
We wouldn&rsquo;t have to do this if you would take your medicine. <br />
(Assistant Grabs Brandon&rsquo;s arm and pulls him out of the coffee shop)<br />
 BRANDON<br />
 (Yelling)<br />
No, stop, let me go! </p>

<p> BAILEY<br />
And I can&rsquo;t go ten minutes without needing a sip of alcohol&#8230; which can&rsquo;t be good for my liver. (Takes a sip from a bottle and winks) shhhhh. Anyways, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it, you&rsquo;re not the least messed up person here, but you&rsquo;re definitely not the worst. </p>

<p> KATIE<br />
Yeah, thanks&#8230; that&rsquo;s really reassuring. </p>

<p> BAILEY<br />
Anyways, I have to get going, I have an AA meeting in ten minutes and they told me if I&rsquo;m late one more time then they&rsquo;re going to prolong my stay another six months. Ridiculous, can you believe it, six months! <br />
(Gets up, grabs her bag and walks out of shop)</p>

<p> KATIE<br />
 (Aside, to audience)<br />
It&rsquo;s not bad here, they only take a flight worth&rsquo;s amount of people at a time on the island so that it isn&rsquo;t too crowded, and so that everyone can have a more personal experience. There&rsquo;s 109 of us here and yet we rarely get any time to talk to each other&#8230; with permission anyways- but rules are made to be broken.</p>

<p>(Jason enters the coffee shop and walks up to Katie, carrying a book bag)</p>

<p> JASON<br />
Hey Katie, thanks for letting me use your laptop! </p>

<p> KATIE<br />
 (Panicked)<br />
Would you keep it down? I told you to leave it in my dorm room, don&rsquo;t take it out here! <br />
 <br />
JASON<br />
Sorry! But hey, I got it hooked up to the complex&rsquo;s internet! It took forever to get in but honestly, the peer pressure lecture was so dreadfully boring that I forced myself to get crack it so I could entertain myself. Hurray for online comics! </p>

<p>
 KATIE<br />
 (Annoyed and Panicked)<br />
You took it out in class? Are you freaking crazy? How did it not get taken away? <br />
 <br />
JASON<br />
Relax, it was an intercom lecture. I literally just sat in my bedroom while the intercom blared things like &ldquo;just say no&rdquo; and &ldquo;if they can&rsquo;t accept no for an answer, they aren&rsquo;t real friends&rdquo;. </p>

<p> KATIE<br />
Good. You know we aren&rsquo;t allowed tech here&mdash;this is supposed to be a &ldquo;natural, cleansing&rdquo; experience. Come on then, let&rsquo;s go to my room and trade off, you can have your Gameboy back, I caught all the Pokemon again. It&rsquo;s a shame you didn&rsquo;t bring more games for the flight. <br />
 <br />
 (Katie stands up and begins gathering her things)</p>

<p> JASON<br />
I did, they just didn&rsquo;t make it past security. Pokemon was in the Gameboy- you&rsquo;re lucky I was able to even hide that in time. No one told me we wouldn&rsquo;t get to keep our stuff once we landed. </p>

<p> KATIE<br />
Yeah. As far as I remember, I wasn&rsquo;t told anything at all. </p>

<p> (Katie and Jason leave the shop. End Scene.)<br />
ACT I<br />
 SCENE 2<br />
(Katie and Jason enter Katie&rsquo;s bedroom. The bedroom is plain, with one single bed and a desk with a lamp on it. There is a security camera in the corner of the room with a sticker that says &ldquo;Smile&rdquo;. Katie puts her things on the desk.)</p>

<p> KATIE<br />
Check the security camera to see if it&rsquo;s still looped will you?</p>

<p> JASON<br />
Sure thing!<br />
 (Fiddles with the security camera for a moment)</p>

<p> JASON<br />
Awh yeah, you&rsquo;re fine. Like I said before, they don&rsquo;t have time to watch all 109 cameras long enough to notice the loop. I wouldn&rsquo;t be concerned if I were you. </p>

<p>KATIE<br />
Great, give it here!</p>

<p>(Jason takes the laptop out of his bag and hands it to Katie. Katie sits down on her bed and opens the laptop)</p>

<p> JASON<br />
(Leans over to look at the laptop screen and point things out to Katie.)<br />
So basically just make sure this programme is always open before you hit &ldquo;okay&rdquo; here for the Wi-Fi to come on. And there you go! Now you can surf the world! I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend updating your Facebook or anything though&mdash;you&rsquo;re sure to get caught then, stuff travels fast you know. </p>

<p> KATIE<br />
Awesome thanks, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow then! </p>

<p> JASON<br />
Alright, if you have any problems you know where to find me! <br />
(Leaves room) </p>

<p>(Katie begins typing on her laptop. Pauses.)<br />
 <br />
 KATIE<br />
What is this?</p>

<p>(Clicks on something. Pauses. A look of shock and horror grows on her face)</p>

<p>Still looking for Canadian Airlines Flight N611&#8230; Chicago to London&#8230; disappeared almost 2 months ago&#8230; but how is that possible? That was my flight. </p>

<p> (Blackout.)<br />
