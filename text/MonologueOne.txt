<p>Satirical Monologue 1</p>

<p>Talking to a drawing or statue</p>

<p>If I weren&rsquo;t so fond of you, I&rsquo;d kill you<br />
Of course by these means you must know that whatever is said here, must stay<br />
And by any means actually&#8230;as a matter of fact<br />
What&rsquo;s that noise? My life is by any means, simple.<br />
Simple, yes, but very exquisite you must know<br />
For I formed your very mind, or a portion by any means<br />
But don&rsquo;t thank me&#8230;oh! There it is, what a beauty!<br />
Do you see its eyes, the way they look at you?<br />
Its wingspan of a thousand football fields?<br />
What a sport! Hat a treasure, a simple life<br />
Simple yet exquisite, I am your father and your mother<br />
You brother, sister and friend<br />
Oh bother I stepped in that ink again<br />
What a mess it always makes<br />
Why don&rsquo;t you have a seat, yes! A seat, and sing us a song!<br />
Hey nani nani nani&#8230; ah yes, where was I?<br />
I am the founder of Atlantic and the maker of the bay<br />
As strong willed as you or I and that my friend is saying more<br />
Did you not hear me? Have a seat, have a seat<br />
Or at least grab a treat, yes! I make the most exquisite treats<br />
I can count to a trillion, this home was made from a billion<br />
Do you understand me young fellow? <br />
Now now, don&rsquo;t be like that its quite rude<br />
As I was, I am a prodigy at four and could speak in the womb<br />
Did you know that child? A quiet fellow you are<br />
My goodness that pacing is getting on my nerves, could you stay still?<br />
And what is that sound? Did you hear it? Tick tick tick tick <br />
Tick tick tick tick<br />
I&rsquo;m four hundred and one and know the exact number of pi<br />
I am the father of four thousand men and- what? <br />
What did you say? Well!<br />
I won both world wars and am the head at every council!<br />
Did you know I was so highly regarded? <br />
Yes yes, I must attend to my spot beside the queen<br />
Come my friend; let us leave this wretched place<br />
What is that sound?<br />
