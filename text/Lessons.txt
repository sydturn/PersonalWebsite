<p>Tough Lessons to Learn</p>

<p>There is an old man who lives in that house<br />
It is made of old brick and creaks from each mouse <br />
He lives all alone, he&rsquo;s never had such one spouse<br />
And wherever he goes, all conversations will douse</p>

<p>The story goes as such, though here: you I warn<br />
He has frightened each one who ever was born<br />
For the story I tell, by it, even he&rsquo;s sworn<br />
And he prides in the truth like a roses sharp thorn.</p>

<p>It starts with two students who lied, swore and fought<br />
In the midst of one fight, by old man they were caught<br />
And at that very moment, their lives he had bought<br />
He gave them a challenge which, with pride, they had sought </p>

<p>He gives them three tests in which they had to compete<br />
&ldquo;The looser lost pride and the winner gains what he beat&rdquo;<br />
Each thinking more highly since the fight had caused heat<br />
They each take their positions and run after cold meat</p>

<p>Breathless; he finishes a second too late<br />
While she smiles with pride and with feelings elate<br />
The second trial is where the old man stands in wait<br />
And with him stands a tower behind a gold gate</p>

<p>The two scurry forward, and the gate is unlocked<br />
The task seems too easy though their visions are blocked<br />
And they climb up the tower while their balance is rocked<br />
And the boy finishes first, removing the blind he stares: shocked</p>

<p>Because below the tall tower stand many tall trees.<br />
The grass, leaves and ocean blow rough in the breeze<br />
And the two stand saluted and with fear they both freeze<br />
Remembering that trials come paired in all threes.</p>

<p>She shakes as her heart beats quickly against her chest<br />
Her palms are sweating, she just wants some rest<br />
But she has yet to finish this one final test<br />
So she swallows her doubt and steps out of the nest</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s falling so quickly, his mind&rsquo;s eye has gone blind<br />
All he can think is how he wants to rewind<br />
And now he&rsquo;s just stuck in this one final bind<br />
While his life flashes quickly throughout his numb mind</p>

<p>They both hit the ground in a crumpled dark heap<br />
Now all they can hear is the other one weep<br />
And both struggle forward while their pride they still keep<br />
But their lost and alone like a flock with no sheep</p>

<p>They notice as one that they&rsquo;re both going to die<br />
And they weep to each other, revealing each lie<br />
No longer in darkness when from light they did shy<br />
As their words quick run empty and their tears just run dry</p>

<p>Now you can hear them, their whispers of truth<br />
And old man still listens from the top of his roof<br />
Reminiscing the story he once forced upon youth<br />
Not feeling one bit of regret or even ruth</p>

<p>Their pride has been jaded, their lies now erased<br />
And both of the teens have been put in their place<br />
Due to the trials of three they both faced<br />
Fighting and lying, their lives they did waste.<br />
