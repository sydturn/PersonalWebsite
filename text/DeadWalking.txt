<p>The Dead Will Walk </p>

<p>The darkened night is cold with winter air<br />
As silent as the casket in the earth<br />
With muddled thoughts we all soon do despair<br />
As dead awake and shout their cool re&shy;birth</p>

<p>With rotten flesh and sunken hollow eyes<br />
What once we loved now fights with sicken'd doom<br />
Our love and care is quick now to despise <br />
And boarden up the once bright sunlit room. </p>

<p>A winless fight it's sure now to become <br />
As living drop'd become disfigured kin<br />
We question why we bother running from<br />
When all that's left is to fall into sin</p>

<p>When hope is gone the battle is to end<br />
And with the dead each man is soon to blend<br />
</p>
