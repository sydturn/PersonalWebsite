This all probably looks very overwhelming. 
When you grab all these files, you'll be able to open up the .html files. I recommend starting with index.html (the home page)
Animation.html is not attatched to the website itself so it has to be opened on it's own. It's just a little canvas animation. 
Animation.html does not use my own art, it is art from opengameart.org and simply for demonstrative purposes. 
My resume.html will only show up properly once it's hosted. You can check it out at turing.algomau.ca/~sturnbull. My whole site is hosted there.

This was done as a class project. Although I was building the website prior to the class using bootstrap, jquery and php, I had to avert all these uses to fit the class requirements and have yet to re-implement them.
