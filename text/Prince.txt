<p>She sat on the floor, knees tucked beneath her with a sponge in her hand and a bucket at her side. With each sweeping motion of the sponge on the floor came the release of white suds which ran down the slight slant towards her, colliding with her knees and soaking her now soiled dress. The room was silent save for the rhythmic &ldquo;squish, splat, slide&rdquo; of the sponge, and the ticking of the big grandfather clock which sat in the corner of the room, speaking as a constant reminder that she was running out of time.</p>

<p>It had been about a quarter of an hour since anyone had entered the room to tell her to hurry up (&ldquo;there's a wedding tonight,&rdquo; they'd say in harsh tones) and now she was beginning to think they had finally forgotten about her. Perhaps the wedding had been called off, maybe the groom had just left the bride so no one will have the privilege of treading on her freshly cleaned and waxed floors. Maybe then she wouldn't have to clean it the next day for yet another wedding (summers were the worst).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The groom is a handsome man&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;a gentleman&rdquo; though she had never met him nor even knew his name. She remembered her boss had told her that the groom was inpatient and had a short temper, but of course that was probably just to scare her into cleaning quicker. So in her wandering mind she imagined a scene where the kind groom, being burdened by his fianc&eacute;e's treacherous moaning, wandered off to get some silence. </p>

<p>His fianc&eacute;e is a wicked woman, she thought, but she was rich and so he must marry her for his family's sake. Oh how he would wish that he could marry a kind, sweet, beautiful poor girl whom he could cherish and take care of, and lavish in gifts. And then during his walk he would pass by the church, the very one that she was kneeling in, then he looks through its window. </p>

<p>By chance, not by fate (for fate did not exist) he would glance through the window and see a beautiful woman looking bedraggled; her hair in a messy bun, her dirty dress spread around her kneeling figure in an angelic fashion. The rising sun would be shining into the room, making her golden hair glow, and he would immediately fallen love with her. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation he would run to the front of the church (which he was soon to be married) and throw the big wooden doors open-<br />
&ldquo;BANG&rdquo;<br />
She was startled out of her trance as the doors behind her flew open and footsteps sounded behind her. Slowly, the new arrival proceeded towards her, heel toe, heel toe, and she sighed in exasperation.<br />
&ldquo;Yes, I know there is a wedding tonight, I've heard time and time again. If I hear it one more time I might scream,&rdquo; she said in a tone she wouldn't dare use in any civil conversation. She didn't turn around but continued scrubbing the floor and as the last word left her lips she heard the footsteps stop; heel toe, heel toe, heel...</p>

<p>The room grew silent again and she began to feel discomforted as a chill ran through her. She turned to look at the visitor and her breath caught in her throat as she viewed the handsome figure standing before her. He stood in a tailored black tuxedo with dark hair parted and gelled to one side and green eyes that pierced her soul. His fit figure could almost be seen through his attire and he smiled faintly as though he found something about her circumstances humorous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I can make you scream if you'd like, though in a different way&rdquo; he responded, and her jaw dropped at his boldness. Perhaps she was still dreaming. He began to move forward again and met her in less than two strides, kneeling down to her level...and then there was pain; she definitely was not dreaming. Pain? Where did that come from? She looked down and watched as her soiled, brown dress became scarlet, and the warmth of blood spread over her chest. As he dropped his hand he revealed the ruby stoned hilt of a dagger which he left behind inside of her, and she accepted her fate as her imagined fairy-tale vanished completely from her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't you hear?&rdquo; He said in a soft, charming tone, &ldquo;There is a wedding today&quot;.<br />
And there outside the church stood a woman in white, gazing up at the sun in a day dream broken only by the sound of another woman's scream.</p>
