<p>1 1/4 Cup of margarine<br />2 cups sugar<br />2 eggs<br />2 tsp vanilla<br />2 cup flour<br />2/3 cup cocoa<br />1 tsp baking soda<br />1/2 tsp salt<br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</p>
<p>1) Heat oven to 350 degrees<br />2) In a large mixer bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy<br />3) Add eggs and vanilla and beat well<br />4) Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt<br />5) Mix flour mixture into butter/sugar Mixture<br />6) Drop teaspoonfuls onto ungreaed cookie sheet and bake 8-9 minutes</p>
<p>Note: When these guys come out of the oven, you're going to be all like "Oh god, these aren't even close to being cooked, I'm going to put them back in". DON'T. Don't do that. They're fine. They'll cool, they'll be amazing. Leave those babies on the cookie sheet until they're cool enough to take off (Otherwise they'll fall apart all over the place) and then put them on a rack to cool the rest of the way.</p>
