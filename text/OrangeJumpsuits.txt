I&rsquo;m leaving this jail, no more will I cry<br />
I&rsquo;ll shed this orange jumper and run. <br />
For nothing can keep me, the harder I try <br />
And I know that this isn&rsquo;t the one. <br />
So I&rsquo;ll open my wings and soaring I&rsquo;ll fly <br />
Fly right into the red, setting sun.<br />
 <br />
You&rsquo;ll chase me all day through the heat from the sun<br />
But you&rsquo;ll follow neither steps nor sound cry.<br />
And each day you will watch the wings as they fly<br />
And have nothing to do but just run.<br />
I can count all your footprints, each one by each one<br />
And watch as you fail each one try.<br />
 <br />
But with every lost day and every failed try<br />
Your skin breaks with the heat from the sun.<br />
And you mark off the days, one day by one,<br />
Hearing every screamed curse that I cry.<br />
Your breath is now lacking as slowly you run<br />
While ahead by miles I&rsquo;ll fly.<br />
 <br />
And as my wings beat, and tirelessly I fly<br />
You&rsquo;re chasing me with no hope but to try.<br />
You can no longer breathe, and no longer run<br />
As I land beside the glow of the sun.<br />
I&rsquo;m watching your tears as you start to cry<br />
And I count your tears each one by one<br />
 <br />
My fluttering wings beat their last one<br />
As I walk with no want just to fly.<br />
And you&rsquo;re shouting in fear in a long, drawn out cry<br />
But you waited too long to just try.<br />
While the sky darkens and gone is the sun<br />
You&rsquo;ll begin to sprint your last run<br />
 <br />
But as you&rsquo;re taking your last, desperate run<br />
You realize I&rsquo;m not the true one-<br />
Who escaped your wrath and ran towards the sun<br />
So long ago when she would just fly.<br />
So all of this was just truly a try<br />
To stop every torn and sobbing, sad cry<br />
 <br />
You&rsquo;ll continue to run back, and I will to fly<br />
Wasting another one day, as darkly, I cry<br />
Since you wasted the sun on a wasted last try.<br />
