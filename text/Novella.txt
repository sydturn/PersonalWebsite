<p>Chapter One</p>

<p> I raced down the hall in a flurrying panic.<br />
 &quot;Mom, Where's my new dress? My ride is going to be here any minute!&quot; I screamed down the hall, avoiding a collision with my older brother Kenny.<br />
 &quot;Watch where you're going!&quot; Kenney growled. &quot;Moms not home,&quot; he continued, this time getting my attention.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What?&quot; I screeched. Kenny looked at me with a blank stare.</p>

<p> &quot;Mom's not home&quot; he repeated tonelessly.<br />
 <br />
&quot;How can she not be home? Prom is tonight, and you're telling me that she's not home?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yeah, she went to go do some shopping. Told me to see you off...whatever that means.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Where's my dress? I swear to you if you don&rsquo;t tell me where...&quot;<br />
 Kenny put his hand up to signal his ignorance and turned out of the kitchen walking up the stairs to his bedroom. </p>

<p> &quot;You'll what,&quot; he looked back at me, &quot;Screech some more? Please, nothing I'm not used to.&quot; he said as he continued his ascend of the stairs lazily.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Or, I'll tell Jessica your secret.&quot; I replied murderously.<br />
Kenney turned back again to glare at me with a half grimace, &quot;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&quot;<br />
 <br />
I caught up to him to get in his face &quot;I would. Now, where... is... my... dress?&quot;</p>

<p>Kenney stared at me for a minute, turned, and went back to hopping up the stairs. </p>

<p>&quot;I dunno where your stupid dress is!&quot; He hollered down at me, slamming his bedroom door and cranking his stereo so I could hear it downstairs.</p>

<p>Frustrated, I headed back down the stairs just as the doorbell rang.</p>

<p> &quot;Oh, no! See what you've done now? They're here, and I haven&rsquo;t even changed!&quot;<br />
Just then, my best friend Sara broke through the door, carrying an arm full of bags and screaming at someone to wait in the car. I assumed it was Sara's date, Joel. <br />
Joel had been a friend of Sara's forever, and you could tell that they both liked each other. Neither would ask the other out, though, they kept saying that it would just &lsquo;end their friendship&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Amber&#8230; What on earth are you wearing?&quot; Sara asked in a calm tone before thrusting the bags into my arms. &quot;Of course, I know you lost your dress, it was at my house.&quot; She continued, walking up the stairs casually. </p>

<p>I gaped at her in horror. Sara&rsquo;s little brother must have gotten to my new dress. He gets into everything, and with my luck, her little brother probably destroyed my 900-dollar dress. Despite my knowledge of the outcome of this mishap, I waited to hear the news that I couldn't stand to hear.</p>

<p> &quot;I'm not even going to bother telling you what happened to it, you can probably guess.&quot; Sara confirmed not 2 seconds after I had finished my horrifying thought.</p>

<p>At that moment I wanted to burst into tears but stubbornly held them back, I would not cry over a stupid little Prom, But then again, who was I kidding? I had been waiting for years for this day! Sara and I had been fantasizing about it since we saw Cinderella in grade three. </p>

<p>&quot;My Prom is ruined!&quot; I sobbed, &quot;I graduate in 8 days, and I don't even get to go to Prom! Every girl teenager needs a Prom!&quot; I cried to Sara, who was already in my room.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, relax! You don't think that I have all these random bags of junk for no reason, do you? By the way you owe me about Two-thousand dollars now.&quot; Sara mumbled.</p>

<p> Of course she didn't mean it, Sara and I had spent so much on each other that if we ever &lsquo;divorced&rsquo; our friendship and had to pay each other back, we would both go bankrupt. I thought about that for a moment before I realized that it wasn't possible. We would be paying each other, so we would basically just be trading money, and that sounded stupid.</p>

<p>Sara began emptying the bags on my bed, hair products, makeup, more makeup, some random stuff with random names that only stylish Sara would know what they were for...where was the dress and shoes? You can't spend that much money on just products! Before I could put my thoughts into words Sara finished emptying the bags and turned to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to lock you in the bathroom,&quot; she said seriously. I stared at the stuff on my bed solemnly then up at Sara.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry&#8230;what?&quot; I asked, dazed.</p>

<p>Sara rolled her eyes and pushed me backwards into my personal bathroom that my father had built for me after my months of complaining. </p>

<p>&quot;I said,&quot; Sara locked the door and kept the key in the lock so that I couldn't open it from my side as she continued, &quot;I'm going to lock you in the bathroom.&quot; Sara then walked out of the room.<br />
 <br />
Once Sara had left, I just sat in the washroom and scanned myself in the mirror. I looked horrible! I was having a bad hair day, was in jogging pants and an undershirt. The blond die was coming out of my hair, revealing brown roots and my hair needed badly to be cut, it was already waist length with terribly split ends. Not to mention my makeup, oh my makeup! I had spent about twelve seconds on it because I was going to miss my ride, and now it was smudged all down my heart shaped face.</p>

<p>I was had only just starting the critical analysis on my boring hazel eyes when I realized that my own date, and boyfriend of five years, Robert, had walked into the room. </p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Oh my gosh, Robert!&quot; I screamed with a huge smile on my face while running up to give him a hug. That&rsquo;s when I realized how I must look to him, making me step back abruptly.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I uhh...um...can you get out? I'm sorry! I have, uhg...I need to get ready...I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, 'ew what happened to my girlfriend,' but I promise, I will fix myself up in no time!&quot; I rambled, trying to push Robert out of the bathroom. Of course, he was a little too tall, too strong, too, Wow. I gave up quickly and looked up to see Roberts face turn from confusion to anger to laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;What,&quot; Robert started, as though he was angry, &quot;Are you talking about?&quot; Robert began to laugh and went up to give me a hug; &quot;You couldn't look more beautiful if you were beauty herself.&quot; He smiled, &quot;Come on, we have to go to Prom now! Doors close in an hour!&quot; Robert said, dragging me out the door.<br />
I stared at him in complete horror as I tried to fight him off, luckily, just then, Sara walked in.</p>

<p> &quot;Get your hands off my patient! And Amber, close your eyes.&quot; Sara sang as I smiled and closed my eyes while Robert let go of my arm. I loved Sara!</p>

<p> &quot;Come on, do something useful or get out, this gal' needs some major help!&quot; Sara growled at Robert while she wrapped something around my face. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure if I should feel a little hurt at Sara&rsquo;s comment, but of course I didn&rsquo;t care, it was kind of true.</p>

<p> &quot;Now, I'm going to fix you right up and we can leave in no time!&quot; Sara said happily. It was obvious that Robert had left the room from the now absent amount of protesting.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, how am I supposed to get changed when my arms are tied behind my back and I'm blind folded?&quot; I asked, while Sara tied what felt like ribbon around my wrists.</p>

<p> &quot;Simple, you don&rsquo;t, I can fix that!&quot; </p>

<p>I hesitated for a second and decided that I better not think about the outcome of this dilemma, besides, I definitely wanted to go to Prom, and was willing to give up a lot more than my dignity to get there!</p>

<p> ***</p>

<p>&quot;Done!&quot; Sara said after what felt like years of much poking, prodding, hairspray, tugging and excessive &quot;hmm&rsquo;s&quot; and &quot;ha's.&rdquo; I had been questioning what Sara was doing and had only gotten those responses out of her over the entire block of time that She was actually working on me.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you ready to see the new you?&quot; Sara asked, untying the makeshift handcuffs and placing her small hands around the blindfold.</p>

<p> &quot;I guess so,&quot; I replied with little enthusiasm. This didn&rsquo;t seem to bother Sara, if Sara was even listening.</p>

<p>As soon as the blindfold came off, my jaw dropped and I found myself gawking at the person in the mirror. Beside five foot tall, naturally blond haired blue-eyed Sara was a five foot eight tall goddess. </p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t trying to be vain, but I did have to admit that Sara had done a stellar job. I was wearing a skin tight, black dress that began to flow out as it went down at the hips. The dress went down to about my ankles and then flew out behind me like a brides gown. It was strapless, with a small, hot pink ribbon tied around my hips in a free bow, and the entire thing shimmered because of its glittery fabric. Then there was my matching, hot pink; gloves that came to my elbows, making my arms look long and sexy. </p>

<p>My light, golden brown hair had been cut to a couple inches below the shoulder, re-dyed to its original colour and put into a curly bun that, in Sara&rsquo;s book, probably had some name, but I just liked called it the &quot;wow&quot; bun.</p>

<p> Of course to add to the excessive amount of hair spray, bobby pins, and apparently sparkles in my hair, Sara had placed a Black rose clip, at the side of my head.</p>

<p> The makeup Sara had applied to my soft, heart shaped face was just screaming, 'look at me!' It wasn't too much, but it was enough to add emphasis on my big, long lashed eyes, red butterfly lips and blushing pink cheeks that were now dusted ever so lightly with sparkles. </p>

<p>What Sara had done on me looked as though it had taken about four hours, which made me wonder how long it actually had taken Sara to prep myself up, let alone herself as well. </p>

<p>Sara was in a soft pink gown that looked as if she had pulled it right from the Cinderella story, but modified to be more modern, strapless and, of course, pink. Her hair had just been curled and sparkled and she was wearing shimmering gloves that were bubble gum pink. She didn't look like she had spent, as much time on herself, but she looked more stunning than ever!<br />
 <br />
&quot;Wow&quot; I finally said, still a little stunned at my transformation.</p>

<p>&quot;Well Amby, Are you ready to make an entrance for the boys?&quot; Sara giggled, reminding me that the guys had been downstairs waiting, probably in the living room for the past forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yah!&quot; I said, thinking back to how Robert had wanted to take me to Prom in my track pants and undershirt, &quot;If he thought I looked beautiful then, wait until he sees me now!&quot; I giggled as the two of us walked out into the hall, to the stairs, and down them into the living room.</p>

<p> <br />
Chapter Two</p>

<p>As soon as I stepped onto the first step of my oak staircase, my life turned into a fairy tale. The brown oak became a marvelous pearl white and everything slowed to a Cinderella entrance. Sara stepped beside me and looked at me, smiling like we were about to get married.</p>

<p> &quot;Ready?&quot; Sara giggled quietly so as to surprise the guys when we got down stairs. I nodded and the two of us continued our decent into a night we would definitely never forget.</p>

<p>In the living room, Joel and Robert were sitting on a couch beside Kenny, looking bored, while Kenny hunched forward staring at the television while Kenny looked as if he was ready to yell at whatever was happening on the television.<br />
As soon as we were visible Robert looked up, then Joel, whose jaw dropped. Robert&rsquo;s eyes looked as though they would fall out of his head if he wasn't careful, and I waited for one of them to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;I...I&quot; Robert faltered, slowly getting off the couch. I blushed and looked away while Sara smiled broadly, almost laughing. </p>

<p>&quot;And what do you think of my wonderful design, guys?&quot; She asked, walking up to Joel who had just stepped up from his seat, looking like he wasn't sure of what to do with himself. </p>

<p>By this time, Kenny had looked up from the show he was watching and was slowly eating a bowl of popcorn that was in front of him, barely concealing his surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s... wow, Sara you're amazing!&quot; Joel said, speaking slowly as though it were difficult for him. Robert had caught up to me and was looking at me in amazement.</p>

<p>&quot;You like?&quot; I inquired, giggling girlishly. Robert nodded, not trusting himself to speak which, of course, seemed understandable to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Great, now that you're all here, how bout you...like...not be here? Thanks. My show is on, and your glittery clothes and brightly, over done makeup is screwing up my vision,&quot; Kenny grumbled, looking back down at the T.V. Everyone ignored him and continued admiring each other. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay, so, how long do we have to get there?&quot; I asked enthusiastically.<br />
Sara paused and looked at her watch.</p>

<p> &quot;Uhm...&quot; she answered, slowly looking up at Joel. Joel raised his eyebrows and nodded. </p>

<p>&quot;Enough time,&quot; he answered for her as he started to drag us out the door.<br />
 <br />
&quot;So, uhm, what time is it, though?&quot; I questioned curiously, stepping into Joel&rsquo;s black, tinted windowed, jaguar. Without answering me Joel started the car and slammed on the gas. My eyes immediately went to the digital clock in the front, which began to blink 7:55, five minutes before the doors closed, and a twenty-minute trip.</p>

<p>I looked at Robert, who was sitting beside me, and wrinkled my forehead. &quot;Five minutes?&quot; I asked, as though asking for his confirmation. Robert shrugged as though it didn't worry him at all. </p>

<p>&quot;But it's a twenty minute drive!&quot; I moaned; cupping my face in my hands, all hope was lost!</p>

<p>Robert put his arm around me and dragged me as close to him as my seat belt would allow, </p>

<p>&quot;Going the speed limit,&quot; he corrected me. </p>

<p>As though on signal, Joel pressed the gas down as much as it would go and we climbed to one hundred and seventy kilometers an hour, making me jump and plastering me to the back of my seat.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my life!&quot; I screeched, covering my mouth as nausea began to engulf me. Sara screamed with joy, and both Robert and Josh began to laugh as though it was a joy ride and they did this every other Friday night. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you crazy, one hundred and seventy in a forty zone?&quot; I screeched, seeming seconds before we slowed to a halt in front of the Agr&eacute;able Danser Salle. My eyes jumped back to the clock; it was seven fifty nine.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we're at the prom, are we not?&quot; Joel asked, already out of the vehicle and opening the door for Sara. Robert chivalrously offered me the same curtsy, and the four of us ran for the doors.</p>

<p>&quot;Glad you could make it!&quot; Melissa; the student council director, said cheerfully, gawking at us in surprise, yet still re-opening the doors she was just about to close. I smiled at her and skipped into the building with an excited screech, making both Melissa and Sara laugh. </p>

<p>The theme of the prom was a midnight fairy tale, and I could tell that the decorations had been carefully chosen, crafted and set up to match that precise theme. Like our dresses, the hall was filled with glitter. There were castles and purple/pink colours everywhere you looked. The room was set up to look as though you were dancing in the clouds, and the lights were set perfectly around the room to look like stars, while some individually chosen constellations hung from the ceiling. Finally, a Shakespearean castle that led to the back garden of the building stood covered in lights and aesthetically appealing decorations.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, this is amazing!&quot; I gasped, as Robert dragged me through the surrounding crowd and the music drummed on. Sara and Joel followed, both looking awestruck at the decorations.</p>

<p>&quot;First, we drink!&quot; Robert sang joyously, heading for the pop table. As I went to follow him, a crowd of students surrounded me and suddenly Robert, Joel and Sara had seemingly disappeared. Moments later I was pulled to the middle dance floor by an unknown hand and spun in a circle.</p>

<p>&quot;My beautiful lady, would you care to lend me this dance,&quot; the man who had grabbed me asked in what sounded like a faked British accent. I laughed and looked up at his face. He had a dark black tux on and his dark hair was slicked back with gel. Two strands of hair fell on each side of his face and curved just to the corner of his dark brown eyes. </p>

<p>&quot;If I should indeed take the honor you the offer?&quot; He continued saying, still speaking in a low, British accent.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course my kind gentlemen,&quot; I laughed; playing along with his curtseys and accents. The man smiled and bowed, taking the tips of my fingers onto his long, outstretched arm and making me laugh again.<br />
 <br />
The music played long and loud, switching from fast, to crazy, to upbeat, and finally to slow. I continued to dance without a single thought as to where I was, and that I was not dancing with Robert but when the fifth slow song came on I moved to sit on the bench, beginning to wonder where Robert had disappeared to, and was followed by the man I had chosen to call Romeo, for lack of a better name. </p>

<p>He kind of reminded me of Romeo, with his sweat talk and the way he was mysterious, yet not so. I had no idea who he was but he was not a bad guy and reminded me of my father who had passed away when I was seven.</p>

<p>&quot;Are your feet weary? Have your lips gone dry? Or has your heart faltered and a memory been aroused?&quot; Romeo asked, looking at me then spinning in a circle to observe his surroundings. I looked at him in confusion and stood up, trying to find a way to reply to him, while still keeping up this game with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;My feet seek the dance floor and my lips only another&rsquo;s. For no water can un-parch them and only ones lips touch mine.&quot; I replied with a smile, speaking quickly with an accent, trying to hide the meaning of my words, which I hardly even knew. </p>

<p>&quot;Then a memory to trouble the hearts of a dancing butterfly. One too far from her colony and surrounded by none but the swinging&#8230;&quot;<br />
I cut Romeo off by grabbing his arms and dragging him to the floor. <br />
&quot;Only a memory. The heart may falter but the wings brush on,&quot; I replied without thinking, referring my feet to be wings and the memory of my lost boyfriend to pass.</p>

<p>&quot;Then let thy wings flow freely and join the swinging flowers in a dance with the wind,&quot; Romeo said, swinging me slowly across the dance floor. I didn't think of Robert as I danced. One night in a fairy tale with a mock prince who had a poetic way of speech couldn't cause any trouble. After all, I had already found the &lsquo;prince,&rsquo; and none of the princesses ever had problems after the prince came into the story. Of course, nothing the prince couldn't fix with a simple kiss. </p>

<p>But then again, what ever happened to the princesses after the kiss? And which story had both a prince and commoner? In which story did the princess end up with the commoner and not the prince? In which story, I began to wonder, was there two men, and a simple damsel looking less for the riches and the prince then for the common man with a heart?</p>

<p> <br />
Chapter 3<br />
&quot;Amber?&quot; A voice I recognized as Roberts rose out of the crowd and pulled me out of my trance. Romeo stopped dancing and let go of me, looking down. <br />
&quot;What are you doing, who is this?&quot; Robert had easily cut through the massive crowd of 800 kids and was now looking suspiciously from me to Romeo and back. <br />
&quot;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you for an hour.... Who is this guy?&quot; Robert repeated, now his eyes had locked on me. I carefully avoided eye contact with him and stood between him and Romeo who was standing behind me looking calm but seeming as though he were searching for something. <br />
&quot;Pardon my folly, but shall I ask what is it that you continue to altercate about?&quot; Romeo asked with a courteous nod. Robert paused in mid sentence and looked at Romeo in confusion, <br />
&quot;Uhm, yeah? You&rsquo;re dancing with my girl!&quot; Robert growled inching closer to Romeo with a glare. <br />
&quot;I&rsquo;m intrigued! Art thou not so grateful as to thank a man who has yet to belittle one of such low attentive, a simple dance, a movement to music for a rescued broad from the absence of an admirer?&quot; Romeo replied, speaking swiftly as though he had spoken like this his entire life.<br />
&quot;Uhm....&quot; Robert looked as though he had been caught of guard and looked to me for assistance. <br />
&quot;What he means to say, is I got lost and couldn&rsquo;t find you, and graciously, Ro-this gentlemen asked me for a dance, which I gave him. You were free to come get me as you wished, but at the moment, I was having fun instead of just being bored because YOU wondered off...&quot; I trailed off, waiting for someone to speak and free me of my rambling. Robert looked at me and back at Romeo. <br />
&quot;What&rsquo;s your name?&quot; Robert asked, bumping his chin up and holding it as though he were inspecting him. Romeo looked at me then back to Robert and seemed to size him up. <br />
&quot;Tis&rsquo; but a name, not a face that you seek? Mine name is but a scar on me, a title that means nothing but a stamp that placed me in a society and wretched family. My name is no less than that of Romeo.&quot; Romeo answered. My mind went suddenly fuzzy and I was slightly confused, but apparently Robert was not surprised or really believing Romeo on this one. <br />
&quot;Great. Romeo meet Amber, Amber meet Romeo.&quot; Robert replied sarcastically looking up to the castle that he was facing. There was a slight pause and Robert looked back down at Romeo <br />
&quot;And Romeo, meet Juliet, I&rsquo;m sure if you hang around here a while longer something will show upon that balcony. Maybe they will be more impressed with you cheesy accent and Shakespearean lingo.&quot; Robert snarled, grabbing me by the arm and dragging me back to the juice table. <br />
&quot;Sorry?&quot; I said, looking at Robert questioningly. Robert looked back with a smile and ruffled my hair. <br />
&quot;No prob, I&rsquo;m not mad, that kids a dork is all, dance with anyone but him, anyone&quot; Robert laughed, pouring a glass of peach juice and handing it to me. <br />
&quot;Guess who!&quot; Sara asked, wrapping her hands around my eyes and giggling joyously.<br />
&quot;Ah, It&rsquo;s after me!&quot; I screeched pulling away and laughing as she stumbled against Robert. Sara stuck her tongue out at me and turned as the music stopped playing and the microphone screeched a high pitch scream. <br />
&quot;And now, announcing this year&rsquo;s 2009 JKRLS' Prom king and queen!&quot; Kevin Hearthwicks voice boomed over the speakers like a jeopardy announcers. I looked up at the clock as the second hand hit midnight and bells went off. There was a drum role and Kevin&rsquo;s voice boomed again, <br />
&quot;Don't let your princess escape you King Alex Craleyon!&quot; Kevin announced to a roar from the crowd. <br />
&quot;Figures, the jock of the school,&quot; I grumbled to Robert who nudged me and laughed. <br />
&quot;That JOCK happens to be one of my closest buddies and the second best foot ball player in this town,&quot; Robert whispered teasingly. <br />
&quot;Second?&quot; Sara asked, as if she didn&rsquo;t already know.<br />
 &quot;Yea next to him,&quot; I answered as Kevin asked for more drum rolls. <br />
&quot;Jessica Allione!&quot; He announced as a skinny blond fluttered onto the stage in a baby blue dress that I was surprise had even covered her but. <br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please congratulate your 2009 <br />
king and queen!&quot; Kevin belted into the mic, as the crowd slowly grew louder. Once the noise had died down Kevin slowly scanned the crowd and brought the mic close to his mouth.<br />
 &quot;And now, for our newly graduating, not quite as old, prince and. princess,&quot; Kevin whispered suspenseful into the mic. &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls... ROMEO CARDIEAN!&quot; Kevin announced to a roaring audience. Romeo walked up onto the stage and took an olden-day bow for the crowd making the girls huff and guys roll their eyes.<br />
 &quot;And our very own...drum roll please!&quot; Kevin continued, as last year&rsquo;s prince took a bow and did a summersault off the stage. &quot;Amber Jefferson! &quot; The entire crowd screamed, or so it sounded like, all except for Robert who glared at Romeo loathsomely. Romeo seamed to glare back with a half smile that would have sent any girl stumbling over their words, and probably feet. <br />
&quot;I...I...I&quot; I stuttered, not wanting to go on stage.... or up to Romeo. <br />
&quot;Oh my gosh, Amber it&rsquo;s you! It&rsquo;s you, it&rsquo;s you, it&rsquo;s you!&quot; Sara screeched, grabbing me by the arm and pulling me to the stage.<br />
 &quot;Oh this is better than ME becoming princess, yes!&quot; she screeched as she pushed me to the stage stairs and watched as I slowly walked up them, trying not to trip. </p>

<p> <br />
Chapter Four</p>

<p> I stared down at the audience as last year&rsquo;s princess skipped onto the stage and pressed a sparkling crown onto my head, along with a sash, and a single rose which I looked at in confusion. I wasn't supposed to get a flower, really? Like what did I just win, a pageant or something? Before I could express my confusion to the girl she giggled and turned off the stage with a swift whip of her bubblegum streaked, blond hair, and Romeo had already come up to me and wrapped his arm around my waist. </p>

<p>&quot;And a rose for none but the beauty of the universe, is it not thou whom I have once spoken so gingerly to already, this sparkling evening?&quot; I looked down into the audience to see Robert still glaring at Romeo, with a red face and a clenched jaw. <br />
 <br />
 &quot;The two, handsome couples will now share the final slow dance of the evening!&quot; Kevin whispered in a mysterious voice. I looked up at Romeo in shock as he smiled, grabbed my arms, and pressed them around his neck. I hadn&rsquo;t even slow danced once with my own boyfriend yet and here I was sharing my last dance with some stranger, while Robert sat hunched on the bench glaring at Romeo with a ginger beer in his hand.<br />
 <br />
 Romeo began to hum and looked down at me as though we had known each other for years, which made me feel more secure, making me slump, more relaxed, in his arms and allowing my own arms to wrap myself closer to him. <br />
 <br />
 &quot;Is this man whom sits shameful in the midst of the darkest corner, closest to thy heart?&quot; Romeo asked after a while, once all the rest of the couples had joined the slow dance. It sounded as though he had let the fake accent go, and it was replaced by a Romanian accent that came out of his mouth as though he had never heard another voice but his own.</p>

<p> &quot;Close in a way...we&rsquo;re dating actually,&quot; I replied, not wanting to think of the proper words to say it his way. The music began to fade out until it came to a stop and changed to Splish-Splash making everyone jump to the dance floor singing and laughing. <br />
 <br />
 Romeo let go of me and lifted his hands so my arms dragged along them when I dropped them.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Why art thou with a man with such controlling concern? Aren&rsquo;t thou lighter without the weight of a thousand rules and laws? Away from troubles that seem to not bother you but eat you away? Aren&rsquo;t thou more lifted without a man who sets rules that only he will ever know all of? Or art though happiest with chains and bonds that breaketh the heart of both family and a many of your friends...other men whomst you hath shaken off, whom have yet had the key to make you happy?&quot; He whispered, holding both my hands and walking to my ears to whisper in them. <br />
 The soft smell of peppermint reached my nose and I breathed in with a sigh. </p>

<p>&quot;Can I have my girlfriend back now?&quot; Robert growled from beside me. Romeo straightened up slowly and began to smile.</p>

<p> &quot;Of course, but just remember, those who are willing, sometimes find themselves in...How you say...stranger places then most know?&quot; he whispered huskily as though he were trying to find words that Robert could understand. It seemed difficult for him to talk even remotely normal, as it was for me to talk like him.<br />
 I turned to walk towards Robert and was caught once again by Romeo, who lifted my chin up with his finger and bent down to kiss me gingerly on the lips. Robert stood there shocked.</p>

<p> &quot;Alright pal! You think you can get away with anything? You even talk to my girl again, look at her in any way, I'll kick you&rsquo;re sweet talkin', sixteen-hundreds acting but, all the way back to Bulgaria where u belong! Got it?&quot; Robert growled, yelling at the end enough making everyone around us stop and stare.<br />
 <br />
 Romeo stood there looking unwavering, as a vein on the side of Roberts face bulged out and his face turned a dark red. </p>

<p>&quot;Er...guys?&quot; I whispered, thinking it was about time that I stepped in. </p>

<p>&quot;We'll have to see about that, for me, it is but a treat to...admire her beauties, whilst for you? Well, may I say; Angels deserve attention. Hide all you want, but I shall wait for your disappearance, to give her EXSACTLY&#8230;what she deserves...all that you can&rsquo;t and all that you won&rsquo;t, thou art too proud to notice your flaws.&quot; Romeo replied, still sounding as though it was difficult for him to speak and picking his words carefully. <br />
 <br />
Robert relaxed, looked at Romeo for a moment, then burst out in a rage, throwing his fist at Romeo and flinging himself into the air. By this point, everyone was gathered around staring at the two while I stood beside them, frozen to the spot. </p>

<p>&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys easy, relax!&quot; Joel huffed as he stepped into the crowed and hauled Robert off of Romeo with the help of Alex Craleyon. Robert continued to thrust out viciously towards Romeo who just stood up and brushed himself off with a blank stare on his face. </p>

<p> &quot;Let me go crayon box! Get off me Angleson!&quot; Robert growled, throwing himself towards Romeo, over and over, trying to escape from the guys&rsquo; grasps. </p>

<p>
Sara walked up to me and looked over my shoulder with a low whistle, </p>

<p>&quot;Football players huh?&quot; she mumbled as we watched the three muscles (as we called them) fight to keep Romeo unharmed. <br />
 <br />
 Finally Romeo shrugged, bowed to me, and with a blown kiss, he walked off and out of the building, leaving the three muscles standing there, lightly holding onto Robert who just stared at the doors in confusion.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ha! That&rsquo;s what I thought!&quot; Robert half growled and half yelled at the door. </p>

<p>&quot;Wow&quot; I said simply, as the crowd dispersed and continued to dance. <br />
Sara looked at me and laughed. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yea wow! Guess you&rsquo;re just too pretty for your own good!&quot; </p>

<p>An hour later, Sara and I were sitting on her porch in jogging pants and t-shirts with the guys and some drinks. It had been a relief to strip off the dresses and makeup that had taken over both of our bodies for the nights, and even more of a relief to take quick showers for the much-needed hairspray and sparkle removal. </p>

<p> &quot;So man&#8230;quite the night!&quot; Alex said with a laugh. He had chosen to tag along with us since his girlfriend had left early because of her curfew.</p>

<p> &quot;Oh yea,&quot; Joel replied in shock. I tilted my head up to look at Robert whom looked down and smiled at me.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Sorry babe,&quot; he said simply, hugging me tighter to his chest. I smiled back and leaned up to kiss him.</p>

<p> &quot;Ew man! Those lips touched Romeo! Avenge me!&quot; Alex laughed, mocking a death scene. Everyone else laughed and Joel pushed him off the concentrate porch with his foot. </p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Juliet, come die with me!&quot; Alex moaned, reaching towards Joel who laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p> &quot;Romeo, oh Romeo! Where fore art though my sweet Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name!&quot; Joel replied in a high-pitched girly voice. Sara smacked his leg and Joel rested his head back on top of hers. </p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead you idiot, gone, fanito! Do not stand on the balcony; do not collect the love of your life. Plus you nit twit, Juliet dies before Romeo!&quot; Sara mumbled sarcastically. <br />
 <br />
&quot;I've already got the love of my life, she&rsquo;s in my arms right now, and guess what?&quot; Joel hummed.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What?&quot; Sara replied as her cheeks flushed bright pink.<br />
 <br />
&quot;She&rsquo;s not dead!&quot; He laughed proudly as though this were an accomplishment. Sara smiled brightly and turned to look at me. I smiled and we all sat in silence for a few minutes.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Sara?&quot; Joel asked, looking over towards Robert and then to the ground. </p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot; She replied sleepily. My heart leaped into my throat and I knew what he was going to say. After all, he had never really admitted to her, nor anyone but Robert, that he liked her, let alone that she was the &ldquo;love of his life&rdquo;.</p>

<p> &quot;I...I don&rsquo;t know how to say this, and I...I...hmm...&quot; He looked back up at Robert who gave him a reassuring nod, urging him to continue.</p>

<p>&quot;I...I Love you! And, I know it sounds...corny...but I never want to let you go...and...I don't want to see you ever kissing someone...other than me...because I...well I love you...and was wondering...if...&quot; Joel paused and looked from the ground, down to Sara, &quot;If you wanted to...if you wanted to go out with me?&quot; Joel said, finally letting the words pour out of his mouth. I looked up at Robert and smiled brightly.</p>

<p>&quot;I meant to ask you at the dance...but I couldn't find the right time...and...I love you&quot; Joel rambled, tasting the three words on his tongue. &quot;I love you,&quot; he whispered again.<br />
 <br />
Sara's mouth dropped and her eyes welled up with tears. Seriously, it&rsquo;s not like he asked her to marry him, shesh! But then of course, Sara had been waiting for this forever. It was a general rule of hers that the girl is never supposed to ask the guy. Not only that but, as pretty and bubbly as she was, she had never had a boyfriend. Of course she also rejected at least twenty guys each year but who was counting? Alex hoped back onto the porch and sat beside Robert with a grin.</p>

<p> &quot;Will you?&quot; Joel asked, seeming to get anxious.<br />
 <br />
&ldquo;What are you stupid?&quot; Sara growled, leaving everyone, even Joel, looking at her in shock. There was a slight pause before Sara got up and kissed him lightly on the lips. She pulled back with a grin then went back for a real kiss. <br />
After a few seconds Sara pulled back and gasped, </p>

<p>&quot;You&rsquo;re a good kisser,&rdquo; she stated, as Joel looked back in confusion and admiration.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Uhm...&quot; Joel replied, not sure what to say.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Sara whispered, less energetically. <br />
 I looked over at Alex who was beaming, with tears in his eyes and had started to clap. </p>

<p>&quot;Sniff! That was beautiful!&quot; he choked. Everyone looked at him and began to laugh, breaking the anxiety and nervous atmosphere. Joel was back to his normal self by the time everyone was done laughing, more jock-like then small and nervous.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Alright ladies, Time to come in! Send the boys home, they will still be here tomorrow!&quot; Sara's mom yelled from inside the house.<br />
 Sara hollered back a quick okay and stood up, forcing everyone else to stand and stretch. <br />
 After some goodbyes, and much hugs and kisses, the three guys were walking backwards to the jaguar waving and yelling I love you down the driveway.</p>

<p> &quot;Bye!&quot; Sara yelled with a giggle, jumping and clasping her hands together with a grin. Robert and Joel took the front seat while Alex turned to take a &lsquo;Romeo&rsquo; bow and blow kisses at us, only to be laughed at and yanked into the car by Robert who stuck his head out and blew more kisses along with Joel. </p>

<p>&quot;Blow kisses at your own girlfriend crayon box!&quot; Robert laughed as they drove out of Sara's driveway. Sara and I smiled at each other then turned to go into the house.</p>

<p>
 <br />
Chapter Five</p>

<p>&quot;What are you so happy about?&quot; Sara's mom laughed, smiling at us as we walked into the kitchen. </p>

<p>&quot;I have a boy friend, b-o-y-f-r-end&quot; Sara sang as she skipped towards the kitchen island and wrapped her arms around her mother&rsquo;s neck from behind. </p>

<p>&quot;Of course you do hun, you&rsquo;ve had one for as long as Amber has been dating Robert! The real question is,&quot; Sara's mom smiled, turning from the dishes to ruffle Sara's hair, &quot;Are you dating this &lsquo;boyfriend&rsquo;?&quot; She continued, looking up at Sara with a mischievous grin.</p>

<p> Sara's mom was amazing, she acted like a teenager and yet still also like a mom, also she loved it when I called her mom or Ally, which was her nickname is high school. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Sara giggled in reply switching Ally's mischievous grin to a genuine smile. </p>

<p>&quot;And! Amber had guys crawling all over her tonight, it got so bad that Robert almost started a fight with one of them!&quot; Sara continued, looking at me proudly. I punched her in the arm and laughed </p>

<p>&quot;Puh-lease, it was one guy!&quot; I gossiped, rolling my eyes when Ally looked at me. <br />
Sara gasped and punched me back </p>

<p>&quot;Two! Don&rsquo;t forget your boyfriend! And Crayon box totally has the hots for you!&quot; I laughed again and coughed. </p>

<p>&quot;So not! He didn't say a word to me all night! Plus he has a girlfriend who, by the way, is captain of the cheer leading squad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Only the bests!&quot; Sara cut me off earning a light smack on the bum from her mom. </p>

<p>&quot;Cheerleaders? Come on, you can't honestly think they are the best! Them with there bleached hair and fake everything! Always walking around with their nose in the air and the buts sticking out as far as they can go!&quot; Ally perked, imitating a pigeon&rsquo;s walk and stuffing her voice up as her nose went into the air. We all laughed and Ally pulled some macaroons out of the oven, filling the kitchen with a mouthwatering aroma and drawing both Sara&rsquo;s attention and mine. </p>

<p>Sara was the first to lunge at it, earning another smack from her mom, on the hand this time as Ally pushed Sara's hand back with a scoff. </p>

<p>&quot;Ah ah ah, still hot!&quot; Ally said as she walked back to the dishes like a pigeon again.</p>

<p>&quot;Sara, I can't believe you wore that out! You are so not allowed to look better then...us!&quot; Ally crooned, with a snuffed up voice, gesturing as though she had a crew behind her. We laughed again and Sara did a runway spin, earning some claps and giving us a curtsy. </p>

<p>&quot;Just like Romeo!&quot; Sara said, standing back up and beaming at me. I rolled my eyes and smiled, </p>

<p>&quot;Sure Sara,&quot; I replied and turned to dry some dishes Ally had placed in the sink. Sara came to join me and the three of us gossiped about the school clicks and posses until the job was finished. With tears streaming down our faces from laughter, we retreated to the living room with some macaroons and all four-scream movies. </p>

<p>&quot;Come on now girls, you have to remember I was once one of those cheerleaders!&quot; Ally said, popping in the first movie and flopping herself onto the leather couch between Sara and me. </p>

<p>Sara obviously got all of her good looks from her mom, I mean, I had never met her dad because he had walked out on them when Ally told him that she was pregnant at the age of eighteen, but I had seen pictures of him and he wasn't that great looking. Ally was beautiful with her long blond hair and blue eyes that matched Sara's, she also had the perfect body. The cheer leading she had done for all five of her high school years seemed to have paid off as Ally could eat as much as her heart desired and just had to walk to the living room to loose any extra fat she had just gained. I always admired her.</p>

<p> &quot;I'll get the popcorn!&quot; Ally sang only moments into the movie when the first two characters had been killed and dismembered. The macaroons had only lasted fifteen minutes and, as Ally said, you can&rsquo;t go through a horror movie without something to absentmindedly munch on.</p>

<p>By close to the end of the last movie, everyone was so drawn into it, and its corny-ness that the half a bowl of the tenth bag of popcorn was forgotten about. Sydney, the main character, had just been killed by her brother, when the three of us jumped up and screamed &quot;No!&quot; All together with petrified stares. </p>

<p>Of course, throughout the other two overly corny horror movies, we had all become attached to all the characters that had made it this far, and since it seemed there was only three characters left from the first movie, it was a shock to see the director kill of the main character. I sat back down and glanced back to the popcorn bowl with frustration.</p>

<p> &quot;Aha, she&rsquo;s gone!&quot; Sara laughed as though with relief. Again I looked up shocked to see that Sydney had indeed moved out of the place of her murder. Moments later the other two remaining characters from the first movie burst into the room, ending the life of Sydney's brother and pretty much the movie. </p>

<p>I looked up at the clock as the credits rolled onto the screen and read 5:00am. We still had about three more hours before we needed sleep, so the three of us finished off the popcorn and headed to the kitchen, laughing about the movie and different comments made throughout it. </p>

<p>&quot;Who wants triple chocolate supreme cookies?&quot; Ally yelled, still completely awake, turning through the pages of her cookbook. Sara and I grinned, hollering our approval and moments later we were throwing half a batch of cookies into the oven, having eaten the other half of the batch which turned out to be okay since only minutes later the fire alarm had gone off and we all had raced back to the kitchen to see that the oven had been turned onto 500 degrees instead of 350 and our cookies had become char.</p>

<p> &quot;How bout we just go to Tim Hortons?&quot; Sara sighed, licking her lips. As if she still hadn't had enough to eat, I had definitely under estimated the power of our stomachs. Next thing I knew there were three Sleepy girls ordering ice cap Supremes at a twenty-four hour Tim Hortons at 6:30 in the morning. </p>

<p>&quot;Arg, So tired, so full, need...arg.&quot; Sara groaned as she collapsed onto the table and tilted her chin up so she was looking at Ally and I. </p>

<p>&quot;Need boys?&quot; Ally asked, still cheerful as the door opened and the &lsquo;Three Muscles&rsquo; walked in, laughing and punching each other&rsquo;s shoulders. Sara looked around and her face went green. </p>

<p>Of course, we were only in undershirts and some thin cotton pajama bottoms, no makeup, messed up hair and probably red eyes but hey, They were just guys right? The guys ordered their drinks and turned to search out a table. Yea...they were just guys, until they started to walk towards us allowing nausea to creep up on me. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys!&quot; Ally beamed, dragging an extra table over to us and allowing the three of them to sit down, </p>

<p>&quot;See girls, I told you that you would see them tomorrow! Er...today...yesterday...yes?&quot; Ally laughed, trading spots with Robert so he could sit beside me. I groaned and inched away from him, earning a side hug and a thick laugh.</p>

<p> &quot;Sleep much beautiful?&quot; Robert asked as Alex and Joel took a seat beside Sara, across from us. I groaned again and dropped my head onto the table. Sara was still looking sick and was also hardly replying to Joel's sweat talk. </p>

<p>&quot;These are the wild bears in their natural habitat. Just awakening from their brief hibernation&rsquo;s, to get hyped up on caffeine, and fall asleep again. Little do they know, as they awaken to the first bite of spring, they will have more then just, gaining weight and growing extra fur to keep themselves pre-occupied,&quot; Alex said in a documentary drone earning laughs from both the guys and Ally. Sara and I looked at each other and at the same time, grabbed the rest of our iced cappuccinos and poured them down the guy&rsquo;s shirts making them jump and holler. </p>

<p>&quot;Agh!&quot; Robert groaned in a half laughing, half complaining voice. He then reached into his empty iced coffee and dumped a dozen ice cubes down my bra, making me jump and definitely waking me up. </p>

<p>The next thing we knew we were all shooting cold ice and melting icecap at each other, leaving us banned from that Tim Hortons and standing in front of it sticky, cold, and laughing until we cried. Ally, being the mature one, walked straight back into Tim Hortons to give the owner an apology but just got herself booted out the door again leaving her snickering yet trying to keep cool. </p>

<p>&quot;What time is it now bra?&quot; Alex asked, stealing Joel's cell phone and flicking it open. &quot;</p>

<p>Aw how cute! A little picture of little Sara all snuggled up beside you!&quot; Alex laughed in a baby tone.</p>

<p> &quot;What? Hey! Lemme see that!&quot; Robert laughed, jumping for the phone as he tried to catch it and avoid letting Joel take it. </p>

<p>&quot;Awe! How cutesy wootsey!&quot; Robert laughed again, yelling at Alex to go long and chucking the phone again. Soon the guys were out of sight and the three of us girls were left standing there again sticky with iced cappuccino and still laughing, </p>

<p>&quot;Football players huh?&quot; Ally remarked as Sara had the previous night. I looked at my Cell phone and saw that it was rounding 8:00am. </p>

<p>&quot;What, no picture of you and Robert?&quot; Sara laughed snatching the phone from my open purse then tossing it back. </p>

<p>&quot;Not yet! But after this, trust me, ill have one soon! Maybe his baby picture?&quot; I laughed. </p>

<p>Ally looked at me and smiled. <br />
&quot;The bath tub ones?&quot; She asked, we all laughed again and I nodded, &quot;oh yes!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alright, Bed time girls!&quot; Ally announced, looking at her watch.</p>

<p>
&quot;YAY!&quot; we cheered and started to walk off.</p>

<p> &quot;Oh hang on.... I left my wallet in Tim Hortons, ill catch up with you guys okay?&quot; I asked, searching through my purse, they nodded and headed around the corner leaving me to rush back to Tim Hortons and pray they would let me in. I rushed through the door getting glares from the men on shift, especially on cleaning. </p>

<p>&quot;Didn&rsquo;t we kick you rotten kids out of here?&quot; The manager yelled, stopping me in my tracks. </p>

<p>&quot;Uhm, yea sorry I...I mean, I forgot my wallet, and I just needed to&#8230;&quot; The manager stood in front of me, pushing me back through the doors, </p>

<p>&quot;Sorry kid, we haven't seen no wallet!&quot; He growled, opening the first door and pushing me through. </p>

<p>&quot;Might there be a problem? A wish against the&#8230;&quot; A Romanian accent whispered from across the hall.</p>

<p>
 <br />
Chapter Six</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, art thou not the rose to my garden, the flower to my life. Else the butterfly whom has been chosen, to be caught in the strife? Alas I know this damsel, release her bonds at once, givest her to me, else thou might find themselves in the darkest pits of despair as punishment. To injure such a fragile soul and beauty to my life, let her go at once, else I draw my knife.&quot; I turned to see Romeo standing behind me and glaring at the man pushing me out. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sorry, my bad Romeo, her and her friends were&#8230;&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Excuses be not wise Alfred.&quot; Romeo cut in leaving Alfred gazing down and reluctantly pulling away from me. As soon as they had left I felt soft hands crawl around my waist and I was hugged to Romeos chest. </p>

<p>&quot;Alas we meet again for such unfortunate events, art thou lost? Or else thy flower missing a petal?&quot; Romeo asked, wrapping his arm around me and placing a hot pink wallet in front of my face. I snatched it and pulled from his grasp, turning around to see him completely topless, showing of his huge muscles and leaving me gawking. </p>

<p>&quot;Can&rsquo;t you read the sign?&quot; I scowled, only half hardheartedly. </p>

<p>&quot;Art thou confused?&quot; Romeo asked, slightly shocked. </p>

<p>&quot;No shirt, no shoes, no service.&quot; I continued, pointing to the sign on the door behind him. Romeo smiled and backed away from me slightly, still holding onto my arms lightly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Tis not the service of them whom I ask of, 'tis that of one, whom has higher the oath and stronger to bear. Thy lips so gentle and thy skin so soft, deep thoughts arns't thou not thy angel I was torn from last night, else all hell broken loose and the weed stolen all thought from thine own mind?&quot; I scowled at him and pulled my arms from his hands. </p>

<p>&quot;Where did you get this?&quot; I asked, waving my wallet in front of his face. </p>

<p>&quot;And don't be giving me no riddle either!&quot; I growled, shutting his mouth and making him think. </p>

<p>&quot;From...thine...I...err...how you say, car...lot?&quot; Romeo replied desperately. I looked at him for a minute and relaxed. He was obviously just trying to help; I didn't have to be so harsh on him. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm...I'm sorry...listen, thanks, but I haven't gotten any sleep yet...and I have to get back home before Sara starts to wonder if I got mugged...thanks,&quot; I sighed, giving him a hug which he returned. </p>

<p>&quot;Art thou needing an escort?&quot; Romeo asked, not letting me go. I laughed and looked up at him. </p>

<p>&quot;Must you say art thou?&rdquo; I mumbled just before Roberts cut me off and ripped Romeo off of me.</p>

<p>&quot;If she wants an escort, I will escort her! Get outa here before I do some real damage on you!&quot; He growled, trying to conceal his anger and taking as much effort as he could not to have to make the guys pull him off of Romeo again. Romeo, who was still looking at me as though nothing happened, slowly turned around to face Robert and smile. </p>

<p>&quot;Simple kind words would get you further in life then those of the devils pet. A maiden in distress and thou weren't hero again? Weren&rsquo;t thou wading in the ponds of freedom with your friends?&quot; Romeo asked, again sounding as though he were struggling for words, but not too much. </p>

<p>&quot;Mhm, yea okay,&quot; Robert replied, pressing his tongue against the back of his teeth. &quot;Sure, 'cause I wasn&rsquo;t keeping an eye on her, you decided it was time you took a try?&quot; Robert asked as his face flushed red. I shook my head, hoping he would see it and ease off, but he didn't. </p>

<p>&quot;Ungrateful for the flower that blooms in thou heart, thou art gone black as darkness and cold as the ice still lingering in thine heart. Twill though ever be grateful for thy beauty you shall have, or shalt thou abandon her more then hold her as delicate as a flower should be held.&quot; Romeo retorted. I shook my head in frustration, why did he keep comparing me to a fragile flower?</p>

<p> Robert blinked and started to laugh, then, becoming serious again, swung one hard punch knocking Romeo to the ground and grabbed my arm. </p>

<p>&quot;Uhm...is he okay?&quot; I asked, as I was pulled away from the building. &quot;Who cares?&quot; Robert replied, dragging me in the direction of his house. </p>

<p>&quot;Uhm, Robert, I have to get to Sara's house. Everyone&rsquo;s waiting for me,&rdquo; Robert continued to drag me with an upset expression on his face, &quot;Did you tell him you were going to Sara's?&quot; He asked, without looking at me. </p>

<p>By this time the other two guys had caught up to us, after making sure Romeo wasn't totally unconscious. </p>

<p>&quot;Dude, he just looked up at the ceiling and started to hum as though it were his favorite pass time!&quot; Alex said, laughing as he punched Roberts arm. Robert didn't even blink but just continued walking. </p>

<p>&quot;Robert, what&rsquo;s your problem with him? He hasn't really done anything wrong.&quot; I asked so quietly that I thought he didn't hear me. Just when I was going to repeat myself Robert stopped walking and glanced at me.<br />
 &quot;I don&rsquo;t know, I just have a bad feeling about him alright, please just promise you'll avoid him?&quot; Robert asked in a pleading tone that rarely came out of his mouth,<br />
 &quot;I didn't mean to see him, ever! But I promise I'll try,&quot; I sighed, as Robert continued walking.</p>

<p> &quot;Can I please go to Sara's house?&quot; I wined after about 5 minutes of walking. Robert looked at Joel who nodded. </p>

<p>&quot;Sara and her mom are going to meet us at my place.&quot; Robert answered and turned into the driveway to his huge house. It had to be huge, after all, all the top football players had a big house so they could have after parties and such, it was the basic rule of high school and Roberts dad also being a very serious football player, took the big house thing very seriously. Luckily the inside of the house wasn't as menacing as the outside, or else I probably would have been scared away on mine and Robert&rsquo;s first official date. </p>

<p>We stepped into the house to music blaring and a football flying across our faces. <br />
&quot;Jake, go long!&quot; Roberts father yelled to a 5 foot 9, brown haired boy, flying past us. Jake looked back at us and smiled as he caught the ball. </p>

<p>&quot;Son! Did yah get it?&quot; Robert's dad yelled from the top of the spiral oak staircase beside us. Jake replied with a holler of triumph and gave the 4 of us a happy green-eyed stare, waiting for Robert, whom Jake had always wanted to be like, to comment.</p>

<p> &quot;Nice Jake!&quot; Robert cheered, ruffling Jake's hair and snagging the ball from him, &quot;Coming at yea dad!&quot; Robert hollered and lugged the football up the stairs. Robert's dad dove down the stares with the ball clutched to his stomach. </p>

<p>&quot;Robert! Amber, Joel, Alex! There are a few friends here waiting for yea in the living room!&quot; He laughed as he did a slam-dunk on the basketball net hanging from the wall. </p>

<p>&quot;Thanks dad!&quot; Robert replied as we walked into the living room. Robert got his looks from his dad, they both had an odd, night sky blue eye colour with brown hair, while Jake had gotten most of his looks from his mom who had died the past year.</p>

<p> As I was only expecting amber and ally to be waiting in the living room, I was quite shocked to see not only them but also Romeo sitting across the room from them and looking like a statue. When Romeo made room for me beside him, I joyously skipped past him and landed on the couch beside Sara who looked at me in frustration. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, I tried to get him to leave, he says he had...some...running or something with a beauty I call my friend...&quot; Sara commented, rolling her eyes while try not to laugh. Joel and Alex squished themselves onto the couch laughing and commenting on how Romeo seemed to show up everywhere, While Robert just stood in the doorway, staring at Romeo who seemed to not even notice him. </p>

<p>Alex was of course the first to speak, <br />
&quot;Romeo oh Romeo wherefore art thou? Why art thou inst my private palace! They will killest you!&quot; He mocked, skipping around the room and grabbing a fencing sword off the wall.</p>

<p> Robert's dad was involved in most sports when he was in high school and just brought his old equipment along with him as got older. </p>

<p>&quot;I will bite my thumb at you!&quot; He laughed, twirling the sword between his fingers. </p>

<p>&quot;Thou will not bite thy thumb at me.&quot; Romeo replied in a dark, quiet tone, standing up to match Alex's height. Alex brandished his sword and jabbed Romeo in the stomach earning a blank stare from Romeo who turned to walk up to Robert. </p>

<p>&quot;Again, Really? You&rsquo;re making my life so repetitive!&quot; Robert growled, throwing a punch at Romeo, &ldquo;And I hate repetitiveness!&quot; Robert barked as he threw another punch. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t know who you think you are,&quot; Another punch, &quot;But I know that you are not welcome in my house,&quot; Once again, he threw a last punch, leaving Romeo standing there unscathed. </p>

<p>&quot;I doth not take offense nor falter at your wrongs. And therefore I doth not underestimate my...how would you put it? Unwelcomeness?&quot; Romeo droned, giving Robert a menacing glare. </p>

<p>&quot;I come on but one request as to pick a flower out of a bed of weeds.&quot; He continued, this time glaring at everyone else in the room. I stood up and walked across the room to stand beside Robert.</p>

<p>&quot;You&rsquo;re, a freak!&quot; I scowled back. I watched as Romeos face changed to confused and slightly troubled. </p>

<p>&quot;Else that whom cared most be eaten by the others wrath?&quot; Romeo asked simply. I stopped and realized how right he was, everyone here has been treating him like garbage except for me, and he hasn&rsquo;t even done anything but save me when Robert wasn&rsquo;t there to do so. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I uh...&quot; I faltered as Romeo caught my eyes. Suddenly I felt very calm, like the last dance during prom. Romeo grabbed my arms and hauled me to his side, without my resistance it was no doubt easy for him. </p>

<p>&quot;What in the hell?&quot; Robert asked as Romeo dragged me out of the room.</p>

<p> &quot;Bye Amber! Thanks for stopping bye!&quot; Robert's dad yelled as I was hauled out of the house and through the door of a Navi that was automatically opened to allow my entrance. I looked at Romeo confused and he smiled back.</p>

<p> &quot;A Navi? What's a Navi?&quot; I asked, as Romeo got into the drivers seat and pulled me into the passenger seat.</p>

<p> &quot;Its a car is it not?&quot; Romeo asked, struggling with his words again. I raised my eyebrows as the doors swung shut and we pulled out of the driveway.</p>

<p>
 <br />
Chapter Seven<br />
Robert stood there looking stunned.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Uhm...what? I thought you said that was Romeo?&quot; My mom asked me. I nodded and looked at her in confusion, <br />
&quot;It was...er is...&quot; I replied as Robert dropped his hands to his sides. </p>

<p>&quot;What the hell...?&quot; Robert sighed, &quot;What just happened?&quot; he asked, sitting down on the brick that was in front of the fireplace. </p>

<p>&quot;Well we came in, you beat a guy up, and he stole your girlfriend! Dude that was so sweet! It was like POW POW POW! Sucker still not down!&quot; Alex laughed, trying to lighten the mood a bit. Robert looked at Alex and raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay so now what?&quot; Joel asked from across the room where he had moved to stop the fight. Robert looked at Joel and shrugged. </p>

<p>&quot;Well...I guess we go find her?&quot; Robert asked, still looking confused and unsure what to do with himself.</p>

<p> &quot;And how do you propose we do that, we aren&rsquo;t CSI agents or anything, and we cant exactly just call the cops and say some guy from prom took off with your girlfriend. I mean we could but we really have no other information to give the cops...&quot; I rambled, frustrated at the current events. </p>

<p>&quot;We have his name...I mean, he won prince didn&rsquo;t he? So you know his last name, and first name, and I would think that the people at Tim Hortons knows the guy if they allowed Amber to stay there and get her wallet?&quot; My mother commented, sounding childish but then again, she was right.</p>

<p>A half an hour later the 5 of us were standing in the police station as the man at the front desk scanned his computer for Romeo Cardiean. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay there&rsquo;s no one under that name, are you sure that&rsquo;s his name?&quot; The cop asked 5 minutes later.</p>

<p> &quot;Pretty sure, that&rsquo;s what everyone has been calling him,&quot; Joel replied in frustration. Robert dragged his hand through his hair in frustration and rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sorry but I cant help you, why don&rsquo;t you go to her place, maybe he just dumped her off back home.&quot; the cop continued, looking bored and sounding inexperienced. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay thanks,&quot; My mother replied, turning to walk out the door. &quot;Okay now we go to Tim Hortons! Who&rsquo;s up for coffee?&quot; She asked with a grin. Alex looked at her and raised his eyebrows at me.</p>

<p> &quot;We were all kicked out this morning remember?&quot; He replied, throwing a pen into the air and catching it again. </p>

<p>&quot;Well then we'll have to get someone else to get me some coffee!&quot; My mother replied in a cheerful tone. </p>

<p>&quot;Like who, my brother?&quot; Robert scoffed, looking at my mom with crossed arms.</p>

<p> &quot;Exactly!&quot; She replied, throwing her arms in the air!</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I sighed and hit my head off the window a few times. We had been driving for about an hour now, neither of us talking, and me having no idea where we were going. </p>

<p>&quot;I always pictured me being kidnapped more exciting then this...&quot; I told Romeo lamely. But it was true, one would think if you were being kidnapped you would be panicked and have adrenaline rushing through your body, or you at least would put up a fight, but here I was, calm as could be, just as though this happened to me all the time. Romeo didn&rsquo;t reply and kept his eyes on the road, humming the same song as he had been &#96;when I had danced with him at prom.</p>

<p> &quot;What song is that?&quot; I asked, still trying to strike up a conversation. Romeo looked at me and gave me a half grin.</p>

<p> &quot;Tis but a song by thine name of beauty, fitting for thy self tis not?&quot; He replied, still staring at me, I looked at the road in complete panic, watching him weave his way through traffic without even looking at the road.</p>

<p> &quot;Car!&quot; I screamed watching him narrowly avoid a Ford mustang and forcing him to turn back to the road with a shrug. We sat for another 15 minutes as I squirmed uncomfortably in the silence.</p>

<p> &quot;Art thou in a position of great discomfort?&quot; Romeo finally asked, making me jump.</p>

<p> &quot;Uhm, where are we going?&quot; I answered, preferring not to answer his question. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, where is it that thy most desire to be on this golden morning hour?&quot; He asked slowing the car to a halt on the side of the highway. I gawked back at him in shock, thinking how it would have been much easier if I had asked my question earlier.</p>

<p> &quot;Home, sleeping?&quot; I practically yelled, setting a smile on Romeos face again. Romeo turned back to the road, and hit the gas, making the Navi screech to a start and bolt down the road.</p>

<p>&quot;Arg! Everyone in this town is crazy! Can anyone here drive normally?&quot; I screeched again as I was thrown against my chair. Romeo smiled a full tooth grin, showing extraordinary white teeth and once again, reminding me of my father. </p>

<p>&quot;I must stop,&quot; Romeo said after a while of rushing through traffic, I sighed in relief as we pulled into a gas station in the middle of town, apparently we had turned back toward town in Romeos driving rampage. </p>

<p>&quot;Fill the beauty,&quot; Romeo told the service guy, forcing an American accent. The clerk nodded and shoved the nozzle into the Navi, walking away to go service another car. </p>

<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s not your real name, is it?&quot; I asked, still bewildered at the fact I had gotten his name right without ever hearing it. </p>

<p>&quot;Tis a name that you admire tis not?&quot; Romeo asked, making me role my eyes.</p>

<p> &quot;So its not your real name then?&quot; I asked, still trying to get the answer out of him. He stared at me in a serious manner and shook his head. </p>

<p>&quot;If not that of Romeo mine identity no longer exists, tis but a name that is of no use to me.&quot; He replied, stepping out of the car to pay the clerk, at that moment someone ran up to Romeo and whispered quickly to him, making him nod and get back into the car. </p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked calmly as he turned on the engine with a panicked look. </p>

<p>&quot;Amber!&quot; Someone yelled as Romeo hit the gas, I turned to see Robert standing outside the other car being serviced, with a flushed face and shocked expression. </p>

<p>&quot;Robert?&quot; I yelled back, as Romeo rolled up the Navi's windows and stomped harder on the gas.</p>

<p>

<p></p>

<p>The five of us stood outside and watched as Jake waddled into Tim Hortons with a grin on his face, he had been thrilled at the idea of being in our plan and had raced to Tim Hortons immediately. Fifteen minutes later he was back out with an apple juice and a tear streaked face. </p>

<p>&quot;Jake?&quot; Robert asked, obviously confused about Jake&rsquo;s tears.</p>

<p> &quot;I know how to make myself cry!&quot; Jake answered ecstatically jumping up and down. Robert rolled his eyes and knelt down to Jake's height.</p>

<p> &quot;Don't turn out to be a drama nerd, you'll ruin the families rep,&quot; Robert told Jake in a half sarcastic tone, &ldquo;now...what happened?&quot; Robert continued as we all stepped forward to hear the answer. Jake looked up with a wide grin on his face and told Robert his story.</p>

<p> &quot;Well I went in and started crying and the dude asked, what&rsquo;s the matter kid? And I said to him that I couldn't find my big brother Romeo, and he was like, Cardiean? And I says, yea that's right, and he looks at me an says Romeo ain't got no brother and so I says I know, but I'm a brother at the big brothers program and he was gonna take me to the arcade today, and then he smiled and says Romeo's a good kid an told me he walked off with some girl last he seen him, and was probably off to come an look for me with her in his&#8230; Navy, but he says Navy like he's proud of it, and I dunno what that is Robert but he says that the girl was probably gonna take me to the arcade too, and I says&#8230;&quot; Robert cut him of with a sharp &lsquo;alright&rsquo;, then stood up and ruffled his hair.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Thanks bud, now go get yourself some ice cream,&quot; He said, throwing some coins at Jake which he caught with a grin and ran off. </p>

<p>&quot;Navy? What the hell is a Navy?&quot; Joel asked, coming up behind me and hugging my neck.</p>

<p> &quot;Its the people who fight for our rights, and freedoms! ...And blow things up!&quot; Alex grinned, looking around for some laughs. Robert looked at him and slapped him across the head making Alex grin even more and stick his tongue out. </p>

<p>&quot;Real mature,&quot; Robert laughed. </p>

<p>&quot;Beats me&#8230; joyride anyone?&quot; Joel asked, jumping up and unlocking the Jaguar with his car remote. </p>

<p>&quot;Sure, let&rsquo;s jet,&quot; Robert said, jumping into shot gun and leaving Alex, my mom and me to occupy the back.</p>

<p> &quot;Hey man! Out, my girl gets shot gun!&quot; Joel said, looking over to see Robert beside him.</p>

<p> &quot;Bros before hoes dude, bros before hoes,&quot; Robert replied as he slammed the door. Joel rolled his eyes and pulled out of the parking lot.</p>

<p> &quot;Oh, a joyride? I love joy rides!&quot; Alex laughed, as my mom looked at him in confusion. </p>

<p>&quot;What&rsquo;s so special about a joy ri...&quot; before she could finish her question, Joel slammed on the gas, bringing us to an alarming speed and making my heart leap into my throat. </p>

<p>&quot;Waaahooo!&quot; I screeched with the guys, as my mother made a face similar to Amber's on the night of Prom. Moments later we were slowing to a halt in front of a gas station. </p>

<p>&quot;I love towns with cops who just don't care!&quot; Robert grinned, looking back to see my mothers face turn from pale to green.</p>

<p> &quot;Oh no, man,&quot; Alex laughed as Joel turned to see what was up. </p>

<p>&quot;Uh no! Not over my baby! Please not all over my baby!&quot; Joel moaned as I shoved out of the back seat to let my mom out.</p>

<p> &quot;Ill bring her to the bathroom,&quot; I laughed, slightly embarrassed. </p>

<p>&quot;No its fine,&quot; My mother replied as she gagged and skipped to the washroom. Everything went quiet and the Gasman shoved the pump into the car. </p>

<p>&quot;That's a sweet car.&quot; Robert grinned at the Jet-black car in front of us.</p>

<p> Every inch of window that could be tinted, was, and it had a sweet silver design airbrushed across the back, bordering what looked to be the brand of the car. </p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked, squinting my eyes to see the lettering. </p>

<p>&quot;Its...&quot; Joel replied, also trying to get a better look, Robert rolled down his window and stuck his head out. </p>

<p>&quot;A Navi, whatever the hell that...&quot;Robert stopped dead and threw the car door open.</p>

<p> &quot;That's Romeo! Navi...frig that's a Navi not Navy, damn it!&quot; Robert growled as Romeo jumped back into the car and started the engine.</p>

<p> &quot;Amber!&quot; Robert yelled as the Navi&rsquo;s front windows rolled up and the car took off. </p>

<p>&quot;Damn it! Go after him!&quot; Robert yelled to Joel who started his engine.</p>

<p> &quot;What about my mother?&quot; I screeched before we could go anywhere.</p>

<p> &quot;We aren&rsquo;t even filled yet, let alone paid for the gas,&quot; Alex mumbled in a bored tone. Robert looked back to where the Navi had disappeared and slumped into the car. </p>

<p>&quot;Great,&quot; He moaned as my mother walked out of the building and the gas clerk put away the pump. &quot;Just great.&quot;</p>

<p> <br />
Chapter Eight<br />
&quot;Just calm down, okay? Easy, relax...&quot; Romeo hummed in a strained voice as I sat on his couch. Once again he was trying to speak normally, I suppose it was for his sake because he knew I was just about to blow my top and didn't need to hear more of his stupid sweet talk. Romeo&rsquo;s house was slightly disappointing. It was small and cozy, more like an apartment than anything else. As soon as I walked in the door I was standing in an indoor porch, which was just a small closed in hallway with a closet for jackets and a mat for your shoes.<br />
 The hallway then led into his living room that branched off into the kitchen. This was only separated from the living room by a wall, a bedroom, and the washroom. What was really impressive was Romeo&rsquo;s choice of colours. Each room was a warm shade of brown with a chocolate brown trimming. Most of the furniture was black with deep red pillows to accent the room. All this was in exception to the kitchen and bathroom. <br />
The kitchen was that of a professional chefs kitchen. Its main colour was white while the counters tops were a black marble. The floor was black and white checkered while most of the appliances were high tech and mostly black. The bathroom was sparkling clean and was a shining pearl white, all accept for the rubber duck shower curtains that were blue. <br />
The house was also filled with olden day paintings making it seem very modern and welcoming. Although before this, I had really expected a mansion with a pool in the back yard. Romeo had a nice wooden porch on the front making the house look like it was from the &lsquo;Little House on the Prairie&rsquo;, but the porch dragged along to the back and turned into a huge lounge with, of course, a large swimming pool, hot tub, gazebo, barbeque and lounge chairs that unbalanced the houses initial complexion. <br />
Romeo had managed to give me a tour of the house before I marched off to the living room in a stubborn rage, glaring at everything I passed. It was rather hard to look angry sitting on his leather couch, because once you sat in it, you slumped down into it, making your original anger look like pure comfort. But, I was managing to pull it off pretty well as I struggled to stay on top of the couch instead of inside it. <br />
I glared up at Romeo as he stood in front of me looking desperate. <br />
&quot;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be living in some kind of stick house and driving around a horse and buggy?&quot; I growled, making him look at me in confusion.<br />
 &quot;If thou art describing that of a stereotype as do your companions, tis not that of an old western story but that of two rich families with houses that have the complexion of mansions.&quot; He answered casually, backing up a little bit and sitting on the coffee table behind him. I glared at him and stood up. <br />
&quot;But your still supposed to ride on horses, not exotic cars that no one has ever heard of!&quot; I snarled, trying to sound harsh. Romeo looked at me with a blank stare and raised his eyebrows.<br />
 &quot;Tis but a casual style made by that of a genius for myself to get from the humble state to the unknown,&quot; He said, as though it were obvious. I dropped my eyebrows and stalked out the back door while Romeo followed. <br />
&quot;Look can you just bring me back home to my boyfriend and mother, and leave me alone?&quot; I yelled, turning around to glare at him. Romeo raised his eyebrows and started walking towards me, making me walk backwards, not letting him get close enough to touch me.<br />
 &quot;Really, you&rsquo;re starting to get on my&#8230;&quot; I cut off as I stepped off the edge of the earth...and into the pool. I gulped for air and instead was choking backwater and sinking to the bottom of the pool. It wasn't very cold at first but after a few seconds of struggling for air, I felt a freezing cold chill seep up into my body. I urged myself not to cry out, or I would loose the little air I had left in my lungs, if there was any at all. <br />
Reaching towards the sparkling sun, I tried in vain to feel the air around the tips of my fingers, but it was hopeless. I knew I was sinking, and I knew that I would probably never feel that air again. This was probably Romeos&rsquo; plan from the beginning. Maybe he was just as Robert had thought him to be, and maybe this is what happened to the princesses after the prince kissed her. But I wasn't a princess and Romeo wasn't a prince, so I guess my logic was a little off. My vision began to fade, and finally, I gave up the struggle. I was leaving myself to sink to the bottom, and to be left there from all other prying eyes&#8230;never to be seen again.<br />

Chapter 9</p>

<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re just going to leave her here?&quot; I screeched as my mother dragged me down the driveway and towards Joel's car. </p>

<p>&quot;Well what do you want me to do? She&rsquo;s not going to come and if we try to get in there, that friggin' Romeo guy is gunna take one of us clean out!&quot; Joel replied, almost angrily. Robert Turned towards Joel and yanked his arm away which Joel had grabbed back onto until we were back at the car.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm gunna take all of you out if you say another stinking word about that freak!&quot; Robert growled, looking at Joel as though he didn&rsquo;t know him. Joel took a step back and looked grudgingly at Robert. </p>

<p>&quot;Cool your jets man, we&rsquo;ll get your girl back!&quot; Joel said, putting on an almost cocky stance. </p>

<p>&quot;Why bother?&quot; Robert almost screamed, &quot;She doesn&rsquo;t want to come back, you heard her! Romeos her boyfriend, she acted like she didn&rsquo;t even know you guys! She acted like I was the freak and he was me.&quot; I looked up at Robert with a pitying stare. </p>

<p>&quot;And your just gunna let Romeo get away with it,&quot; I said pointedly, half smiling at myself and half loathing Roberts response. Before Robert could move to retort, Joel hoped into the car and pulled him inside. </p>

<p>&quot;Listen man, I&rsquo;ll mark the place down on my GPS and we'll come back later. We gotta think this through before we do something stupid and put anyone&rsquo;s lives in danger.&quot; Joel stated logically as my mother and I hopped into the back seat. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, We could always go to the cops!&quot; My mother stated, sounding unusually shy. </p>

<p>&quot;We already went to the cops remember? And how&rsquo;d that turn out?&quot; Robert growled again, sounding calmer then before. My mother put her head down in a shy manner and buckled her seat belt. </p>

<p>&quot;We'll get her back,&quot; I said, trying to sound confident, more trying to convince myself then her or the boys. </p>

<p>
As Joel pulled into Robert's driveway, the first thing I saw was a flash of white, and then nothing at all. I could hear commotion outside of the car, but wasn&rsquo;t sure what was going on... the house had been fine a few seconds ago. Instantly, idea started flashing through my mind, sending me into even more of a blind panic, what if the house was bombed? Where&rsquo;d my mother go? What happened to the guys, or even just Robert's family?</p>

<p>&quot;Babe! Can you hear me?&quot; Joel hollered, sounding as though he were miles away. I nodded my head in confusion and tried to get up. </p>

<p>&quot;No! Don't get up hun, just lie down and relax. We're gunna call an ambulance okay?&quot; My mothers voice called from the other side of me.</p>

<p>&quot;Crap man! What the heck was that?&quot; I heard Robert say from what sounded like right over me. I tried to make more sense of what was said next but I felt as though I was falling, and had to concentrate on landing properly or grabbing hold of something... or someone.</p>

Chapter 10</p>

<p>I woke up on the monster couch, which had tried to eat me earlier, and a white fuzzy blanket thrown over me carefully, despite the twenty-eight-degree weather outside. Sweating profusely, I stood up and threw the blanket on the floor, trying to recall what had happened before I fell asleep. I could only remember drowning in a pool and waking up here... but there was something else I couldn&rsquo;t remember. As I struggled to recall the details of the last few hours, or days, I noticed a piece of paper folded carefully on the table. </p>

<p>Good morning my love! I hope you slept well; I just went out to deal with some... business? I love you and I'll be home later with supper! Xoxo</p>

<p>I scanned the paper a few times before I realized that it hadn&rsquo;t been signed, which of course, struck me as odd because someone with the name of Romeo aught to have signed a note as un-detailed as this one. I growled and sat back into the couch, which proceeded to try and devour me. And then it struck me: Why would Romeo have left me a note like that? Shouldn&rsquo;t that have been Robert's handwriting? And why was I so convinced that the letter was from Romeo? I jumped up and shuffled into the kitchen, still feeling groggy, and looked around at the unfamiliar interior designing while wracking my mind for an explanation of why I was here.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a buzzing on the counter and I realized my phone was sitting in the sink, doused in water. Why the hell was my phone covered in water, and why was it still working? The lack of answers and my abundance of questions left me wanting to scream as I dried my phone off with a towel before looking through my recent texts, all of which were from Robert. </p>

<p>Babe, I don't know what&rsquo;s going on, or if you'll even get this text, but if you do, I&rsquo;ve forgotten about last night... I just want you to come home babe... Sara&rsquo;s in the hospital on Elk Street... maybe if you find the time to remember her, you should stop by. Robert.</p>

<p>Despite the depressing tone of the text message, I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the look of Roberts name in my hands.</p>

<p>Then, All of a sudden, everything came back to me. I remembered the dance, and Sara&rsquo;s sleepover and Robert... Then being kidnapped by Romeo and drowning... But why had Robert just walked away after coming to save me from Romeo? I stood there, stunned as I stared at the text message on my phone. Then another text came in, this one from an unknown number.</p>

<p>Remember I left some of your medicine in the fridge, and to take it before noon or else it won&rsquo;t be effective remember?</p>

<p>I stared at the new text message in a dazed confusion, meds? I don't take medicine? I walked to the fridge and opened it, searching through it until I came across a bottle of kids purple grape medicine. I stared at it, confused, until it occurred to me who the text message was probably from. It was at least 5 o'clock by now, way past the time I was supposed to take it, which meant its effects had probably mostly worn off, but after reading the bottle I still didn&rsquo;t know why I had been taking it. Deciding against further investigation, I began to rush quickly around the house in search of anything that I would need when I left, making sure I hadn&rsquo;t left any possessions in Romeo&rsquo;s house. Then, grabbing my phone, I headed out the door, just as Romeos Nazi crawled up the driveway.</p>

<p>Romeo stepped out and smiled at me, which I growled to in response. </p>

<p>&quot;Ist thou heart so frail or doust your mind trouble you so as to aim such venom towards my kind gestures?&quot; He asked, walking towards me to give me a hug. I shoved him off of me and threw a punch at his chest to keep him off. </p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; I scowled, marching towards him with rage. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I mean, what&rsquo;s wrong babe? I was mocking that oaf Romeo, what do you think? I&rsquo;ve been practicing!&quot; He winked, speaking in a strained, Romanian accent and not moving as I threw another punch at him. </p>

<p>&quot;Get the hell out of my way you freak!&quot; I screeched, trying to veer around him. Just then, Romeos pupils dilated and he narrowed his eyes. </p>

<p>&quot;You didn&rsquo;t take your meds,&quot; He said pointedly, grabbing me by the arm. I tried to pull back but Romeo wrapped his arms around my waist and pushed my face up to look into his eyes. The next thing I knew, I was completely relaxed and was fading out of reality.</p>

<p>Chapter 11</p>

<p>I sat on the edge of the hospital bed looking like I had died and come back to life again. I had woken up about two days after the confusion at Roberts house and still had no idea what was really going on. <br />
 <br />
 The only person who had visited me since the accident was Roberts father, Rock, who proceeded to tell me that he was sorry for the &ldquo;mishap&rdquo; in a nervous tone. Of course, I was glad to have the visitor, but still slightly disappointed that Joel had only visited twice, at both points I had been sleeping, and he had left before I had woken up. The only proof of Joel&rsquo;s visit was the twelve pink roses on the side of my bed; 6 for the first night he came, and 6 for the other. But I didn&rsquo;t want roses I wanted an explanation. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your pulse rate is back to normal, so is your blood pressure. You don&rsquo;t appear to have any cardiac damage, no damage to your skull&#8230; all brain trauma and anything that remained of your previous concussion have seemed to clear up&#8230; I must say, that was an impressively quick recovery! We&rsquo;d like to keep you for another day just to be sure you&rsquo;ve completely healed, then you&rsquo;re free to go!&rdquo; Dr. Anderbosh chirped as though he had the best job in the world. I examined him carefully as he smiled and talked to one of the nurses.</p>

<p> He had dark black hair (definitely dyed) with bulging grey eyes that made him always look tired. He looked like he was around seventy, but of course he was only fifty as he had stated proudly when I asked him. He was fairly tall, and his hair seemed to shoot out in all directions like he had recently been struck by lightning. Dr. Anderbosh deeply reminded me of some kind of mad scientist, and frankly, I was tired of him being so happy all the time, especially after having to put up with him for a week and a half. </p>

<p>&ldquo;So, now that I&rsquo;m healed, and less likely to be suffering from uh&#8230; post dramatic stress,&rdquo; I began, as the nurse Dr. Anderbosh had been talking to left the room. Before I could finish, he turned around and lightly flicked my jaw in a joyous manner. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Traumatic sweet heart,&rdquo; He corrected, and then waited patiently for me to finish.<br />
I stared at him blankly. As if it mattered what it was, it had the same meaning&#8230; pretty much. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Post&#8230; Traumatic Stress&#8230; And don&rsquo;t call me sweetheart, can I know why the heck I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo; I practically yelled as frustration bubbled up in me like a straw in chocolate milk. <br />
Dr. Anderbosh continued to smile, oblivious to my hate for him, which seemed to be growing by the minute. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope! Special request that the men who brought you here tell you, I just tell you the diagnosis and help you recover hun!&rdquo; Dr. Anderbosh sang again, this time heading to walk out of the door. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad I haven&rsquo;t seen them in a week and a half!&rdquo; I screamed after him, throwing my fists at my pillow. </p>

<p>A few hours later I was still lying facedown in my pillow, wishing the day to finally be over so I could go and hunt down my stupid boyfriend and his best friends. I didn&rsquo;t see why it was so difficult to at least just peak his head in and say hi or something, but of course, I knew that there had to be a real reason for Josh&rsquo;s weird behavior. Almost as if on queue, I felt someone rest their hand on the small of my back, making me roll over in surprise with a big grin pressed on my lips. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Its supper time darling,&rdquo; the nurse standing above me smiled. Her smile also bothered me. Honestly, people working at hospitals shouldn&rsquo;t be so happy. It was bad enough that you have to wake up to your own pain and misery, but to wake up to everyone else being so happy and jolly&#8230; the feelings you wish you could have, could almost kill a man. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo; I hissed in an undertone, hoping she could here the venom in my tone, of course, her attitude was unchanged, just as the doctor&rsquo;s had been. <br />
Seriously, it was almost as if the people in this hospital were hardwired to make my life a living hell. Just then, the man I wanted to see stepped through the door holding another dozen roses. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I missed last week, I got caught up with Robert,&rdquo; Josh half smiled, making my heart melt. &ldquo;But come on babe, of course your hungry, I brought you subway!&rdquo; Josh pulled out a cold cut sub from the bag he was holding along with the flowers. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Where the heck have you been?&rdquo; I screeched in a murderous tone. Josh stepped back and smiled half-heartedly, &ldquo;I told you last time you were here&#8230; I said Robert and I were working everything out&#8230; that was when I asked you if you wanted to press charges.&rdquo;<br />
Josh looked at me as though I were some alien from another planet and suddenly it occurred to me that I didn&rsquo;t actually remember anything since this morning, and anything that happened before this unknown accident. </p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean I&#8230; I&rsquo;ve spoken to you since the accident?&rdquo; I faltered, ready to burst into tears. This whole time I was so angry at him for not coming to see me, when he had probably spent whole hours talking to me, sitting right beside my bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So then I&#8230; I guess I should know what happened then?&rdquo; I asked almost in horror. Joshes face turned to a pale white and he looked like he was going to puke. Before he could reply, Robert walked into the room carrying a baseball bat and wearing a cap hung backwards over his head making him look like a tobacco spitting baseball player. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope! Haven&rsquo;t told you that one yet have we Josh?&rdquo; Robert asked, barging into the conversation and ruffling Joshes already scruffy hair. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes we-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well of course we haven&rsquo;t! Right josh?&rdquo; Robert cut in again, putting emphasis on the word &ldquo;right.&rdquo; Josh looked at Robert as color came back to his face and gave his cheeks the pink glow they always had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And quite frankly!&rdquo; Robert continued in an undertone, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t need to know either! Right doc?&rdquo; Robert turned to the nurse who had come in to tell me that it was time to eat. The nurse looked back at him in confusion and tried to reply while stumbling over her words, before she finally quickly scurried, embarrassed, out of the room. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I need to know?&rdquo; I asked murderously. I didn&rsquo;t just sit in a hospital for two and a half weeks for nothing, I wanted to know why the heck I was here, and I wanted to know now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa, cool your jets tiger!&rdquo; Robert laughed, balancing the end of the bat on his palm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen here!&rdquo; I practically screeched, swinging my legs over the edge of the bed and knocking my IV slightly. Josh jumped over to the IV and held it up as it stopped pulling with my body. Robert had become this big jerk of a guy apparently ever since Amber was pretty much kidnapped. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Grawr!&rdquo; Robert huffed as Josh grabbed me by the shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy babe, it was no big deal, you just got smashed in the face with a baseball&#8230; that went through the window&#8230; and apparently came from neither Roberts dad or brother but that&rsquo;s not the point.&rdquo; Joshes words were quick paced and mumbled together, making it hard for me to understand his usually calm and low voice. <br />
I looked up at Josh then to Robert who was leaning on the side of the door as if he were a rock star, examining the scratches in his metal bat. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay so then who hit it?&rdquo; I mumbled, giving Robert an accusing glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing&#8230; we don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rdquo; before Josh could complete the last word of his sentence I had jumped up off the bed and was looking straight into his eyes in disbelief. But from the look he was giving me, it was true. Josh looked at me in frustration and longing, wishing he had an answer for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did you ask if I wanted to press charges?&rdquo; I asked him, ready to burst into sleep deprived tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I thought we would be able to figure out who the person was. It was Rocks&rsquo; ball, and had come from the direction of his house. The way it went through the window and how hard it hit you either says that the person who hit it had a strong swing or was close&#8230; but there&rsquo;s no way to figure something like this out&rdquo;. Josh seemed as though he were talking to himself more than to me, and zoned out into space like he was trying to make some sense out of everything that had happened&#8230;but he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Chapter 12</p>

<p>The next day, I left the hospital with a feeling of victory. The doctors made me feel like I had survived a massive explosion and I was apparently lucky to be out so soon, especially with nothing but a few stitches from where the doctor had been forced to pick out shards of glass from my arms, face and neck; the result of the shattered windshield from Joshes car. </p>

<p>Josh met me in the parking lot with Robert who was driving a new Porsche that he had apparently just gotten for his birthday today. It never struck me the whole ride to Roberts house, how much pain Robert was in, from both his girlfriend being gone, and her seeming to love some freak of a man, but once we all stepped into Robert's usually immaculate bedroom, it was clear he was suffering from some sort of depression. </p>

<p>The room was dark, with an eerie feel to it. Even with his light on, the room was so dim and depressing that the sun didn&rsquo;t even appear to have the confidence to try and shove its way through Roberts&rsquo; black curtains. Clothes were strewn on the floor; both clean and dirty, as well as pictures and items that Amber had given him on multiple occasions. His bedroom had a muggy texture to it and smelt as though he had left a few wet bathing suits shoved in plastic bags under his bed for too long, yet it still had a faint hint of the old Robert. </p>

<p>A slight smell of old spice and honey hung in the air as it tried to fight a hopeless battle against the stench that was trying to consume it, while a quite out of place king sized water bed sat in the middle of his room, perfectly made as though it were Roberts last, desperate attempts to stay sane.</p>

<p> Of course the last, and most depressing thing in Roberts room was the three thousand dollar ring that Robert had spent his last years salary saving up for. It sat on his bedside table, open as though it had already been shown to his hopeful bride to be, and sparkled in the dim overhead light of his room. It was a white gold ring with three decent sized diamonds on in, forming almost the shape of a hill. The band twisted around in a delicate pattern, ending in a mount that rose across the top of the ring, to lift up, and give emphasis to the diamond. Last, engraved on the inside of the band was cursive writing, spelling out both Robert and Ambers name with a heart that led into the words, &ldquo;till death do us part&rdquo;. This was of course, Roberts proposal ring that he had hoped to show to amber the day after Prom, in an effort to be with the women of his dreams through his whole life and on. Of course, we all knew how well that plan had turned out. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Dude, what the heck happened here?&rdquo; Josh gapped as his jaw dropped in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean what happened? Its comfier this way,&rdquo; Robert replied in a raspy tone, walking over to his bedside table and brushing everything off it. I watched as he tapped the lid of the ring box closed and chucked it to the side in a pile of junk, making sure to watch where it landed. Josh coughed, obviously noticing the same thing I did as Robert brushed all of our last bits of hope, off into a pile of junk. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that your&#8230;&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; Robert barked, cutting Josh off. It seemed he had started to make a habit of it as he jumped onto his bed and started fiddling with a rubrics cube that had been left on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would it be an engagement ring? What am I, Loved? Ha! Look at me; I&rsquo;m alone and defenseless. I lost my girl to a cheep brand of perfume. If it were that easy to lose her, than why would I have bought an engagement ring for her? Nawh that? That was just more garbage I found lying around my room. Just rubbish.&rdquo; Robert ranted as he finished his rubrics cube twice. </p>

<p>Josh and I stared at Robert's helpless form and I couldn&rsquo;t help but agree with Robert&rsquo;s lost hopes. I too, had run out of hope, and we all seemed to have given up, that is of course, before Roberts phone started screaming &ldquo;girlfriend alert&rdquo; At the top of its tiny microphone. </p>

<p> <br />
Chapter 13</p>

<p>I ran. I didn't think to stop where I was going or what I was going to do when I got there, but I continued to run. The thought that I wouldn't be fast enough to out run him didn&rsquo;t even occur to me. I just ran as fast as I could, concentrating on my breathing and trying not to panic, because I knew that I couldn't continue running if I even thought of what would happen if I got caught&#8230; or how Robert would feel when he realized that I was gone. </p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get far until darkness surrounded me and I was lost and left with no sense but the feeling of strong arms around me. At first I thought it was Robert, but when I turned around, I saw the face of Romeo in the dark. Confused, I watched as it evaporated and became Roberts again, and then switched back to Romeos with a deafening crack. I had been caught again; there was no way I could run. The point of view changed to that of Romeos and I watched as my own body collapsed to the ground.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I woke with an earth-shattering scream that must have woken up the whole neighborhood. My clothes were once again drenched in sweat and I had a pounding headache that made me feel like I had a fractured skull. I had been having almost the same dream every night for the past two weeks, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that something was trying to tell me something.Robert ran into my room looking panicked. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Love? Amber...&rdquo; Robert coughed, speaking in a jumbled accent like he so often did when he was miffed. </p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He moaned. As if he didn&rsquo;t already know. Every night it was the same, and he always just fed me some Tylenol and sent me back to bed. I vaguely remember the Tylenol once being a purple liquid, yet somehow, without me buying them, they were transformed into a strong pill that put me out as soon as I took them. This of course made me not want to take the pills but I couldn&rsquo;t for the life of me find the purple liquid that I had been looked for, for a whole week. I assumed Robert had just thrown it out so I often just settled with the pills. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, take these, it&rsquo;s your dreams again isn&rsquo;t it? We ought to go see a doctor about this,&rdquo; He groaned as he sat on the edge of my bed, looking as though he had been awake for hours. </p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I moaned as he tried to push a cup of water that was quickly dissolving the pills, into my clutched hands.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to take them, they make me forget things, and at this rate, I&rsquo;ll never figure out this stupid dream and I&rsquo;ll never stop having them!&rdquo; I was rambling again like what I had become accustomed to ever since I moved in with Robert. He didn&rsquo;t often let me say what I had to say, so when I did try, I always had to say it in a rushed slur so that I could get my full thought into the conversation before he changed the topic or spoke his own thoughts. All this was odd to me, it seemed as though Robert had lost all remembrance of how to treat a girl once I was living with him.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right Amber, they are stupid, so just take the pills and forget about the dreams. We will go to a therapist tomorrow.&rdquo; Robert growled, pushing the cup towards my face. I cupped my hand over my mouth and slapped his arm back, backing up against my bedpost in one swift movement. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Why do you act like this, what happened to you?&rdquo; I hollered as I jumped out of bed. Robert quickly followed and I watched as his appearance shimmered before my eyes, making me dizzy. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Just take the stupid pills Lisa! It will all be better by morning!&rdquo; He yelled back, thrusting me against the wall and trying to force the water down my throat. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Lisa?&rdquo; I said, stopping and staring at Robert whose arms quickly went limp as he backed away from me in a confused manner. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose Lisa?&rdquo; I asked harshly. Robert continued to stare at me in desperation until he finally stopped backing up. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I never said anything about Lisa&#8230; are you okay babe?&rdquo; He asked coming closer to me again and cupping my cheek in his hand, which forced me to stare into his eyes. I watched as his eyes transformed from Roberts blue to a dancing grey then back to blue again. &ldquo;Just please, drink the water, it will be better in the morning Amber, I promise.&rdquo; I calmed down as a shiver ran up my spine and I stared at the water, but there was still something in my subconscious mind that was telling me something was very wrong. </p>

<p>The feeling of unease seeped its way into my body again, as it so often did when I was around Robert, yet I still had an out of place feeling of comfort that kept the unease at bay. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to drink the water,&rdquo; I mumbled as I looked down at both of our feet and touched his hand that was still resting on my cheek. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Robert questioned. I searched around the room, trying to find something other then him to look at, and my eyes rested on the bedroom door. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen those grey eyes before.&rdquo; I thought to myself in a daze. The colour was not very common, yet it often came to Robert's eyes, leaving me with a feeling of revulsion. I didn&rsquo;t remember his eyes every changing colour before I moved in with him. Of course maybe I just wasn&rsquo;t observant enough. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me just&#8230; go back to bed okay? I&rsquo;ll take them tomorrow or something.&rdquo; Robert hesitated as he watched me slide out of his grasp and back into my bed, searching around in the dark for my blankets. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; He mumbled as he turned and walked out of the door. &ldquo;Whatever you say.&rdquo; As Robert closed the door, I heard the obvious click of the lock, turning my calm feelings to that of absolute panic, but before I could think much of it, I had fallen back to sleep and was lost in my dreams of running again. And that&rsquo;s when I saw it, those grey eyes Roberts&rsquo; so often changed to. Romeos. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The next morning my door was open and the sun was shinning bright through my open maroon curtains. I pushed my Red quilt to the side of the bed then dragged myself up and through the door. The house smelt of blueberry waffles and bacon, which wasn&rsquo;t an uncommon occurrence in the morning, and I walked into the kitchen to see Robert dissolving more pills into the next batch or waffle batter. I stood and watched him for a few minutes before finally making my entrance, slipping up behind him and hugging him from the back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning love!&rdquo; I whispered in his ear, as he turned to look at me with a smile. Robert's eyes had turned a lasting grey and I watched as his face shifted from Roberts to Romeos and back again like a mirage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! I know you&rsquo;ve already made these and all but why don&rsquo;t we just pop them in the fridge for&#8230;er&#8230;lunch?&rdquo; I asked as I watched him pour the drugged batter into the waffle maker. Robert&#8230; or should I say Romeo, huffed a quiet chuckle as he closed the waffle maker and turned to give me a kiss. &ldquo;Well then what do you want for breakfast love?&rdquo; Romeo asked huskily as his normal accent mixed with his Romanian one. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go out for once? We never go out!&rdquo; I complained in a girly tone. Romeo looked at me suspiciously and then looked out the window to the bright blue sky.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Sure we do,&rdquo; Romeo replied in a cheery tone, &ldquo;We go into the backyard and swim, and we have picnics in the forest in our backyard and,&rdquo; I cut him off as he started to list more and more things that we would do in out backyard.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Yes but Rom&#8230;The Roman empire is a lovely restaurant, remember we used to go there all the time in high school, and you said when we moved in together we could go all I want, because its my favorite,&rdquo; I chirped quickly, trying to cover up my knowledge of his true identity. Romeos face softened and he looked into my eyes, tilting my face up so that I couldn&rsquo;t look away. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow okay? Or we can go for lunch.&rdquo; He pondered as I tried to look away. Suddenly a growing feeling of understanding and content passed through me and I settled into his newly outstretched arms.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Okay, lunch it is,&rdquo; I smiled as the words tumbled out of my mouth. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want breakfast, I&rsquo;m not really hungry,&rdquo; I moaned as the two of my emotions fought for the lead role in my mind. Romeo looked back out the window and started fiddling with a butcher&rsquo;s knife that was left in the sink from the night before.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Robert?&rdquo; I whispered, wrapping my one hand around his and using my other to take the knife away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a waffle, just let me go shower first okay babe?&rdquo; </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I threw myself through the bathroom door and locked the door behind me. I had to find my cell phone! I only remembered just then that I even owned one, but my memory was quickly coming back and I was reminded of the day I found it in the sink when I tried to run away the first day. </p>

<p>Ever since that day Romeo had not left the house once, and when asked, he always said that he was taking a sick leave because of my dreams.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I know it has to be here someplace!&rdquo; I mumbled to myself as I rummaged through the towels and opened every pill jar we had. All I could think of was the buzzing I would sometimes here when I was in here showering or putting on makeup. </p>

<p>Throwing around the magazines that were sitting beside the toilet, I finally found a leather bound book about the thickness of the bible, and opened it up. Inside I found that it had a hole right through the center of all the pages, and there, surrounded by toilet paper, was my cell phone.</p>

<p> I couldn&rsquo;t understand why Romeo still kept my cell phone lying around, as If he didn&rsquo;t think I would find it, but I assumed he just kept it around to laugh at Roberts&rsquo; texts that would sometime come in. Clicking into my contacts, I found that there was now both Romeo and Robert under the R&rsquo;s. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo; I whispered, hearing footsteps coming up the stairs. I quickly shoved the book away and jumped into the shower, turning it on and backing away from it so that it wouldn&rsquo;t get my phone wet. As the water soaked through my pajama pants, I tried to figure out which name was Romeo and which was Robert. Of course, if Romeo thought I might find my phone and try to text Robert, Romeo might have switched the numbers so that I was really texting him, unless he figured I would think of that. Finally, I settled on texting both of them, and just hoping for the best. </p>

<p>My fingers shook as I typed four letters, and a simple code Robert and I used to use to say &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Help. Evolu.</p>

<p>Quickly, I sent the text and shut the phone back off, jumping out of the shower to trade my wet clothes for dry ones as the sound of Romeos ring tone screamed throughout the house. &ldquo;Girlfriend Alert, Girlfriend Alert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chapter 14 </p>

<p>&ldquo;Amber, what&rsquo;s wrong? What&rsquo;s going on in there?&rdquo; Romeo called in a thick accent as he smashed on the door with his fists.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay, I can&rsquo;t turn off the water, I slipped and fell in the tub and I&#8230;&rdquo; Before I could finish my sentence, Romeo smashed through the door and swung the curtain open. </p>

<p> &ldquo;I knocked the tap and water started spraying everywhere, I&rsquo;m sorry&#8230; I just panicked and&#8230;&rdquo; I stuttered, stumbling over my words as my hands began to shake. Robert slowly reached his hand into the shower and turned it off, sliding the phone out of my hand with a smirk. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, but thy sheer beauty is more then thy smarts. As if I would know&#8230; where did you, my blossom, find this intriguing device?&rdquo; Romeo drawled, flipping the phone open and searching through the messages on the phone. </p>

<p> &ldquo;I&#8230; it was in that book,&rdquo; I choked, pointing to the leather book that was not sprawled on the floor as I searched in vain for an explanation. </p>

<p> &ldquo;It was buzzing and I didn&rsquo;t know what it was and&#8230;what is that lying around for? Since when did you have a cell phone, I thought your old one broke,&rdquo; I growled, trying to play dumb and turn the blame on him. Romeo&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and he dragged me out of the shower with malice. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Dost thou thinkest me to be a fool? I know not why you would deceive me in such this way; do you think I know not why you&rsquo;ve done this? Doth it please you; flower, to go behind minst back and stab me so hard with the sword in which I gave to you? For if mine mind weren&rsquo;t so keen I might believeth you but nye, this last message was received not but four weeks ago and you try to decive and play my mind like a game. Whomst might this Romeo character be that you would also sendeth him this bland message of hope?&rdquo; Romeo growled, throwing me against the wall and barking every word in my face until I was crouched at his feet with his face not two inches from mine. </p>

<p> &ldquo;You are.&rdquo; I said simply, throwing my fist and hitting him in the jaw. Romeo&rsquo;s head wiped back out of surprise and I took the moment to leap from under his crouched body and through the open door. Romeo didn&rsquo;t take long to recover and was behind me before I even reached the end of the hall. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah but you the flower and I the sun,&rdquo; Romeo cooed, grabbing my arm and dragging me to the couch. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Dost though knowest why you know me not for whom I am?&rdquo; Romeo laughed, watching me struggle under his grasp. </p>

<p> &ldquo;You stupid jerk, Let me go!&rdquo; I screeched at him, ignoring his question. Romeo didn&rsquo;t loosen his grip but came closer to my face and shoved me onto the couch, leaving me curled into a ball as he leaned on me so that neither my legs nor arms could move.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Dost though knowest why you know me not for whom I am? He repeated, now growling in a low and quiet tone.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not who you want? I&rsquo;m not Lisa you creep, and I never will be! And you know what? For whatever reason she isn&rsquo;t with you know, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a damn good one!&rdquo; I howled, watching, as his face grew even more distorted with his anger. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Do not speakith about that which though dost not know but nothing about!&rdquo; Romeo screamed in rage, slapping me across the face, making me scream out with annoyance. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Than tell me why you&rsquo;re so freaking messed up!&rdquo; I sighed, relaxing as Romeo&rsquo;s body relaxed and he lifted my face to look into his eyes like he did so often. I shivered as my mood battled against what I wanted to be and what he was making me be. Romeo paced over to the window and stared at the pool as the water shimmered from the wind brushing its surface.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I thou weren&rsquo;t so fond of thyself maybe thy mind would not be so corrupt.&rdquo; Romeo started, turning to me with narrowed eyes. <br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Maybe if thy mind weren&rsquo;t corrupt then thy lips would be able to serve the justice that thy mind is capable of. Doth thou newest who you are? Thy beauty and thy heart is non other but of mine love, if thy soul weren&rsquo;t so shadowed then thy breath would be as sweet and your voice as sound as Lisa&rsquo;s. Would thy heart understand my lips as they spoke with the winds song? Them closest to thy heart doth not know the meaning of the heart, the meaning of thy words and the motion to thy hands. Family is not thy closest and greatest gift, nor your friends nor enemy&rsquo;s. I have hidden thy most daunting thoughts, and have blocked the most counterfeit recollections. I do my best to allow thy mind to comprehend thy meaning and purpose of thy existence. Art thou so stubborn as to believeth that you shall not be mine? Come my maiden, leave you&rsquo;re past and come and live in thy future you were destined to breathe.&rdquo; Romeo spoke sweetly as though what he was saying weren&rsquo;t all nonsense and stupid.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Okay, so what you&rsquo;re saying is that you think, because you&#8230;lost this Lisa character, that I should replace her&#8230; because I&rsquo;m exactly like her?&rdquo; I scoffed, almost laughing. Romeo clenched his jaw and shook his head.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Thy presence and soul is the beat of Lisa&rsquo;s heart. Tis only your body that changes your existence.&rdquo; He retorted, trying to make me understand. I coughed out one loud laugh and rubbed my forehead in annoyance.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Okay, so I&rsquo;m Lisa?&rdquo; I question. Romeo nodded his head as I continued.</p>

<p> &ldquo;And you stole me from my friends and family because you love me?&rdquo; Romeo coughed and corrected me.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Lisa.&rdquo; He sighed, trying to make me understand. I nodded and continued.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Okay, you don&rsquo;t love me, you love Lisa, and I&rsquo;m exactly like her, except for my&#8230;looks and so, you took me from my life, and drugged me up to make me forget everything and think you were Robert&#8230;where did you get these pills?&rdquo; Romeo shook his head and leaned against the wall, making it obvious that he wasn&rsquo;t going to answer.</p>

<p> &ldquo;And by erasing everything I once knew, and playing mind games, you expected me&#8230;to never figure you out, and then marry you, so that you could be with Lisa again?&rdquo; I growled in disbelief. Romeo rolled his shoulders back and grinned with a half smile as I began to try and get up off the couch. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Is this, or death,&rdquo; He stated simply. I stared at him, trying to make it obvious to him that he was a nut bar.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I am not Lisa. I am not Lisa trapped in a different body, and I am not going to marry you.&rdquo; I mumbled pointedly. Romeo got up and walked over to me, staring me in the eyes.</p>

<p> &ldquo;You were easy you know. I could have chosen many girls to shape into my Lisa but I chose you. You know why?&rdquo; Romeo said, speaking in a dark tone, loosing his accent and grabbing my face so I couldn&rsquo;t look away.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I shuddered.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Because. You were easy. All these years I&rsquo;ve tried to find someone I could manipulate. Someone that was easy enough for my stupid, weak powers. And then I found you at the prom. There with you stupid, ugly, dress, looking oh so lost!&rdquo; Romeo whimpered like a baby, mocking my mood in his story. </p>

<p> &ldquo;And I took your arm and immediately I felt that you were weak!&rdquo; He barked, spraying saliva on my cheeks. </p>

<p> &ldquo;And I danced with you, and I ordered you to dance with me, ordered you with my mind. And there was no resistance. And when I looked in your eyes, I could make you feel the emotion I wanted to make you feel, and I could calm you and make you feel content and happy, make you not argue or&#8230;run,&rdquo; He slipped his right hand of my cheek and made his fingers walk across his right arm, then looked mach at me with a maniacs eyes. </p>

<p> &ldquo;And you were so easy to manipulate, with a mind like clay, I could mould any images in your mind that I wanted to, just as long as you took these pills.&rdquo; He whispered, opening his right palm and revealing the white pills I had been taking for the last few months.</p>

<p> &ldquo;An essence of me, oh yes. This way I could get into your mind with nothing but a thought and manipulate your imagination. Of course, you weren&rsquo;t as week as I had hoped. I couldn&rsquo;t make you think what I wanted you to think but manipulating your sight and the way you saw things was good enough for me.&rdquo; I tried to back away as he moved the pills towards my face.</p>

<p> &ldquo;To bad, like all good things, the time I could manipulate your mind was at a minimum and my essence would die within a few hours, but you kept taking the pills, such a good girl.&rdquo; Romeo huffed, closing his palm and brushing my cheek with the back of his hand.</p>

<p> &ldquo;And your friends were easy to get rid of. After the first incident of you almost slipping away at the sound of poor Sara&rsquo;s voice calling your name, I knew I had to get rid of her, so&#8230;bloop!&rdquo; He laughed, flicking his wrist like he was throwing a ball. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Home run!&rdquo; He laughed again, this time darkening his tone to make his laugh sound menacing. <br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Now, take the pills like a good girl.&rdquo; Romeo growled, opening his palm and positioning my shaking head so that I was looking in his eyes. My body instantly relaxed again and I struggled to re-gain control of my own emotions. </p>

<p> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I screamed in a shaky voice. Romeo took that opportunity to shove the pills into my mouth, just as a loud banging sounded at the door as someone tried to gain entrance to the house. Romeo didn&rsquo;t even flinch. Quickly, he shoved my jaw close and I writhed in his grip, trying to spit out the quickly dissolving pills while he massaged my throat to make me swallow. Then, just as the door was thrown open, I my body forced the drugged saliva down my throat and the room went dark.</p>

<p> <br />
Chapter 15</p>

<p>Robert slipped his phone out of his pocket and stared at it with an open jaw.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; I mumbled, not trusting the obviousness of who it should be. Without a word, Robert let the phone slip out of his and crash to the floor before he jumped up and ran out the room with Josh in hot pursuit.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Wait guys!&rdquo; I shouted, jumping up off the floor from where I had cleared a spot to sit and chasing after them. I got to the driveway just as Josh slammed the passenger door and Robert slammed the gas, pulling out of the driveway and speeding down the street. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Guys!&rdquo; I screamed again, running down the driveway and watching the sports car disappear into the distance. I stood there in frustration until Robert&rsquo;s dad came out of the house and grinned at me. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Hey sweetheart, Robert just left, he should be back later if you wanna stick around and play some hockey?&rdquo; He mumbled, looking at me with hope in his eyes. I smiled back half-heartedly and shrugged. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Yea I know&#8230; I was supposed to go with them,&rdquo; I mumbled as I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my inbox, hoping to find a new text from Josh. I searched to no avail and finally settled on walking to Robert&rsquo;s bedroom to see what the boys we&rsquo;re all frantic about. <br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll stick around for a bit and chill in Roberts bedroom.&rdquo; I continued, watching Rock&rsquo;s face go downcast.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p> I slowly slid into the bedroom and shuffled my way through Roberts&rsquo; depressing mess before slipping the battery that had fallen out of the phone, back into it and pressing the power button. I sat, leaning against Roberts bedpost in content until his screen finally came up with the text that Amber had sent him. Slowly the text registered in my mind before I too dropped the phone and stood up in a panic. </p>

<p> &ldquo;She remembers,&rdquo; I gasped as the blood drained from my hands and face. I snatched the phone back up and tried dialing my mother&rsquo;s number, leaving a message on her machine telling her to get to Romeo&rsquo;s house ASAP. Frustrated, I paced around the bedroom and finally decided on my last hope. Alex. </p>

<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up my man, long time no chat, how&rsquo;s your hunt going bra?&rdquo; Alex answered, hollering to someone in the background that he got the phone. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Hey Alex, it&rsquo;s me, we&rsquo;ve got a problem,&rdquo; I grumbled in the phone. Alex answered with a huff of surprise before I continued to tell him everything I knew from the past few hours. <br />
 &ldquo;Oh okay, that&rsquo;s cool, so, you wanna go for a joy ride?&rdquo; Alex laughed making me roll my eyes. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Yes Alex, I need a ride.&rdquo; I replied, not having the time to argue my case. Alex laughed and agreed to pick me up in five minutes before hanging up the phone with some comment about Shakespeare. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, my love, thou shalt beith the flower scented air freshener to my car,&rdquo; I heard from him before clicking the end call button. Moments later Alex had pulled into Robert&rsquo;s driveway in a big yellow jeep with profanity drawn in the dirt that clung to the side of it. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Hop in my man, let us proceed into this opportunity of,&rdquo; Before Alex could finish; I slammed the door and yelled at him to drive. Josh paused with a raised eyebrow and slammed on the gas, driving as fast as Josh had been when he pulled out and away from me.</p>

<p>
I stood with my face to the door, listening to what sounded like Amber talking to Romeo in a harsh tone. </p>

<p> &ldquo;And by erasing everything I once knew, and playing mind games, you expected me&#8230;to never figure you out, and then marry you, so that you could be with Lisa again?&rdquo; She growled in a harsh tone. I turned to Josh who stood beside me and raised an eyebrow. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Lisa?&rdquo; I asked while Josh shrugged and turned his attention back to the door. I understood his annoyance with me at driving off without his girlfriend but he didn&rsquo;t understand the urgency of all this, beside, Sara would just get in the way. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Home run!&rdquo; I heard, turning my attention back to the conversation on the other side of the door. By this time, Josh&rsquo;s face had gone to a pale white and he looked like he was about to smash the door in. I shook my head in confusion, unsure of whom the man speaking to Amber was. Although I knew it should have been Romeo, the man&rsquo;s dark, non-accented tone was different from the one I expected to hear. </p>

<p> There was a few more harsh words said that I couldn&rsquo;t make out before Amber screamed a sharp &ldquo;no&rdquo; making me jump. I wasn&rsquo;t going to stand back and listen in on whatever was happening, not with that that tone in Amber&rsquo;s voice. Quickly, I stood up and grasped the door handle, feeling the tightness that indicated the door was locked. </p>

<p> Josh nodded his head and without a word, we both pressed our shoulders to the door and backed up a few paces before forcing all of our weight on the door and throwing it open. </p>

<p>
Alex pulled into the driveway just in time for me to see Robert and Josh rush through Romeo&rsquo;s broken door.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; Alex commented, for once at a loss for words. I threw the door of the jeep open and jumped out, waiting for Alex who raced forwards ahead of me, almost in a panic. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; I heard Robert growl from inside the house. Alex and I stepped through the door with scared expressions, watching as Robert grabbed a calm Romeo by the collar and shook him violently. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, we meet again. The beauties beast and the nemesis of true love.&rdquo; Romeo sighed; speaking the same way he had at every other occasion I had met him during. Robert roared in annoyance and tried to throw Romeo across the room, only to watch as his shirt fell back into place and he took a step back. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Who the hell are you? Tell me now before I beat every will you have out of you, you stupid, ignorant&#8230;&rdquo; Robert took a step back as Romeo lunged for him and threw him against the wall, forcing Josh to step forward and attempt to help him. </p>

<p> &ldquo;No! This is between him and me!&rdquo; Robert growled at Josh, just as Romeo turned around and grabbed Josh, kneeing him in the stomach and tossing him to the side where he lay with his head bobbing at his chest and his back to the couch.</p>

<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pathetic,&rdquo; Josh huffed, trying to get a proper breath of air. I went to walk towards him, just to be held back by Alex who stood with a serious expression on his face. Alex&rsquo;s expression alone was able to hold me back away from the fight, it wasn&rsquo;t often Alex was serious of the football field, so when he was, people tended to listen. </p>

<p> Romeo turned back to Robert and held him firmly against the wall, digging his elbow into Robert&rsquo;s stomach so that it was painful for him to move. <br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; Romeo repeated Robert&rsquo;s question back. Robert stared at Romeo with menace and gave his head a slight nod, urging Romeo to continue. </p>

<p> &ldquo;I am your worst nightmare. I am Romeo, I am the one who is going to steal your life for what your grandfather took from me.&rdquo; Romeo growled almost in a sad voice. With this, he threw a punch with the hand that wasn&rsquo;t holding onto Robert, landing it in the wall, right beside Robert&rsquo;s head. </p>

<p> &ldquo;My grandfather is dead.&rdquo; Robert said pointedly, obviously unsure of what Romeo was talking about. Romeo shook his head and spat in Robert&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Exactly, so whom else am I supposed to get vengeance on?&rdquo; Romeo growled as he lost his accented sweet talk and his voice transformed into a dark, husky tone that almost literally chilled the blood in my veins to a chilling discomfort. Robert continued to glare at Romeo until he continued with his tale.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re clueless, you&rsquo;re easy. Just like your girlfriend.&rdquo; Romeo mumbled, as Robert&rsquo;s body went from tense to limp. I gawked at the two of them and watched out of the corner of my eye as Josh stood back up and hollered in a loud voice. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Robert, don&rsquo;t listen to him. Take control of your own body, don&rsquo;t let him decide how you feel.&rdquo; Josh shouted, making Robert&rsquo;s confused expression turn back to anger. </p>

<p> &ldquo;How does he&#8230;?&rdquo; I whispered as Alex threw a hand up, signaling me to be quiet. Just then, Amber walked into the room, drawing Robert&rsquo;s attention and earning him an elbow in the stomach. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah yes, tis but your love isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Robert continued, still in a low husky voice. </p>

<p> &ldquo;See, you&rsquo;re grandfather took my love, so I say, why shouldn&rsquo;t I take yours?&rdquo; Romeo continued his story as Amber looked at him with a scared expression. </p>

<p> &ldquo;My grandfather took nothing from you.&rdquo; Robert retorted. Amber cocked her head to the side and walked up beside Romeo, grabbing his arm mournfully and turning to Robert in anger.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Robert, why is he here again?&rdquo; She whispered, talking to Romeo in a sad voice. Robert&rsquo;s face went pale and he began to squirm in Romeo&rsquo;s grasp. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry love; I&rsquo;ll get rid of them.&rdquo; Romeo replied, throwing a punch at Roberts face and making him stop squirming. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Amber please,&rdquo; Robert whispered, being careful not to move. Romeo dug is elbow into Robert&rsquo;s stomach harder this time, making Robert cough in response. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Your grandfather took everything from me! He took her, he raped her, and he killed her. And I never, saw her&#8230;again&#8230;&rdquo; Romeo barked as sorrow filled his voice. Robert stared at Romeo with a hardened expression and shook his head. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Robert?&rdquo; Amber mumbled, shaking her head in confusion and looking at Robert. Romeo growled with a low grunt and threw is arm backwards, landing the back of his hand across Amber&rsquo;s face and making her drop to the ground. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch my girlfriend!&rdquo; Robert howled with rage, ripping himself out of Romeo&rsquo;s grasp and throwing himself on Romeo. I watched as the two men stood up in front of each other and started speaking in tones too low for me to understand. Amber slowly sat up and crawled over to where Josh was still sitting, leaning against the couch in pain. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; I heard amber moan to Josh over the growing voices of Romeo and Robert. </p>

<p>&ldquo;You are insignificant! I, I am the world! I am timeless, I am Romeo Capulet and you will do as I ask!&rdquo; Romeo finally roared making Robert freeze and go calm. </p>

<p>&ldquo;You will leave now,&rdquo; Romeo said as Robert huffed in anger and turned to walk out of the door. </p>

<p>&ldquo;No way man!&rdquo; Alex finally said and leapt at Robert, forcing him away from the door. Josh stood up in panic just as Romeo lunged at Robert and Alex and threw them both against the wall, turning to me next. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, flower, calm as the breeze that brushes against the water on a summers day. Hush love, hush,&rdquo; He whispered, coming closer to me and speaking again in a low Romanian accent. I fought against the calm that was beginning to overpower me and stepped out of his range just in time before he lunged forward to where I used to be. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush hush,&rdquo; He turned again, staring at me in the eyes and cornering me against the wall in a cocky fashion. I began to panic as he leaned forwards with his lips. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush hush yourself moron! Don&rsquo;t touch my girl!&rdquo; Joel hollered in annoyance, ripping him off my just as his lips brushed mine and his hand began to curl around my waist. I stood in shock, clearing my mind to the view in front of me.</p>

<p>Romeo lay sprawled on the floor beside the limp bodied Alex and Robert, struggling to sit back up. </p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to realize your place,&rdquo; Joel continued, walking over to Romeo and throwing a kick to his side. There was an obvious cracking sound, signaling the breaking of Romeo&rsquo;s ribs and Joel kneeled down to roll Romeo over onto his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And get some professional help.&rdquo; Joel finished, landing a final blow to Romeo&rsquo;s face and breaking his nose. Romeo curled his lip in anger and tried to stand up again, only earning another kick from Joel, softer this time, just to add pain to his probably already agonizing form. Slowly Joel walked back over to me and smiled, motioning me away from the wall and allowing me to run over to the petrified looking Amber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amber, do you remember me?&rdquo; I asked, just about ready to burst into tears. Joel walked over to Robert and slapped his cheek lightly, shaking his head as Alex let out groan. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert?&rdquo; Amber whispered again, shaking her head in frustration. I frowned and turned to Romeo who had managed to roll onto his side that wasn&rsquo;t too badly injured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amber?&rdquo; I said more sternly, trying to snap her out of her trance. Romeo smiled a sly grin and sat up more straight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love, help me up?&rdquo; He whispered as Amber crawled over to him slowly. Amber placed her hand on Romeo&rsquo;s heart that happened to be the side his ribs were broken on, and smiled sweetly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go of me,&rdquo; She whispered as Romeo cringed. Romeo shook his head and his grin became almost evil while he tried to force amber to look into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, why would I do that?&rdquo; He groaned, trying not to show his obvious agony. Amber smiled more venomously before she thrust all her weight onto the hand that was pressed against Romeo&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not as weak as you thought I was,&rdquo; She finally said in a stronger voice as Romeo&rsquo;s body collapsed to the ground and he began to choke on blood. Josh finally woke Robert up and the three muscles walked over with curiosity to stare at Romeo as the light drained out of his eyes and the blood ran out of his face.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Chapter 16</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are we gunna wait till Juliet show up or?&rdquo; Alex said after a long pause. Amber laughed a trill laugh and pushed Alex away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what? You need to actually read the play,&rdquo; She laughed again as Alex stumbled over the doormat and out the door. Robert sat against the wall and stared at her as she walked slowly back into the room with no Alex and up to Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; She said simply as Robert reached up to embrace her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even save you,&rdquo; He grumbled in a monotonous voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Amber whispered back, leaning against his chest and letting him rest his head on hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I am&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then, my mom ran into the house, carrying her cell phone and staring at us all with a gaping expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sara! You are in so much trouble when you get home!&rdquo; She screamed, staring at Romeo&rsquo;s lifeless body then turning to Amber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where has your mother been through all of this nonsense? I&rsquo;ve called her countless times and&#8230;&rdquo; Robert looked up at My mother and gave her a stare that shut her up quickly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about this all later&#8230; for now, we have to call the cops,&rdquo; Joel huffed, turning and walking towards me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already done!&rdquo; I said, smiling at him as two police woman walked in. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well, what do we have here?&rdquo; The one said as she walked over to the body. I opened my mouth to speak but was silence by the second woman who looked down at Romeo and gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well if it isn&rsquo;t Mr. Cowgale, we&rsquo;ve been searching for him for months&#8230;&rdquo; the second policewoman said. I raised my eyebrow in a questioning way and was quickly answered by the first cop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we don&rsquo;t have to ask too many questions, this isn&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;s tried to kidnap his own daughter.&rdquo; She said, staring at Amber. Amber&rsquo;s jaw dropped and she looked down at Romeo with a shocked expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8230;what?&rdquo; Amber gawked, looking from Romeo to the police. </p>

<p>&ldquo;It also would explain why your mother&rsquo;s been missing for the time you&rsquo;ve been here. Probably ran to hide, Casey, go call the station and find Amber&rsquo;s mother&#8230;tell them to tell her that Mr. Cowgale is dead and she is safe to come home now.&rdquo; Casey, the second cop, nodded and walked out of the house with a sad expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he&#8230;how can&#8230;I thought,&rdquo; Amber continued to mumble in confusion. The first police woman smiled at us and walked over to close the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the ambulance here soon, none of you look too beat up, have a seat and we&rsquo;ll chat, I&rsquo;m officer Banks, feel free to call me Jasmine.&rdquo; The first police woman said, motioning to the couch. Once the five of us were settled on the couch with Jasmine in front of us, it wasn&rsquo;t too long before everything began to make sense.</p>

<p>Jasmine spoke to Amber mostly, answering Amber&rsquo;s questions and comforting her thoughts. As it turned out, her father had a severe case of Schizotypal personality disorder&#8230;he didn&rsquo;t have boundaries and didn&rsquo;t know how to act around other people, especially after Amber&rsquo;s mom divorced him for obvious reasons. That and he had multiple personality disorder which didn&rsquo;t help his case. It explained why he was always switching between personalities. But Amber&rsquo;s father was able to control some of his disorders to match what or who he wanted to be, so with that, mixed with the hallucinogen pills he was feeding Amber; he was able to manipulate Amber&rsquo;s thoughts and imagination. </p>

<p>Apparently he was feeding her other drugs as well, stuff to make her forget, and things to make her weak and help him manipulate her. And last, there was his rare ability to manipulate people just by getting eye contact. Mr. Cowgale was able to transfer his emotions to the person he had eye contact with so that, by seeing the sorrow in Mr. Cowgale&rsquo;s eyes, the person would relax or react accordingly. There were very obvious reasons that Amber&rsquo;s mother divorced him, and tried to hide his real existence from her Amber. </p>

<p>&ldquo;So, my father didn&rsquo;t die when I was young?&rdquo; Amber questioned in annoyance as Jasmine finished her explanation. I laughed and turned to my mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, mom, got anything to tell me?&rdquo; I said in a hopeful voice. My mother gave me a half smile and shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid he did just leave us when you were four,&rdquo; She sighed, patting me on the back. </p>

<p>&ldquo;What? I thought he left when I was three?&rdquo; I screeched jokingly, laughing as my mom shook her head. Amber jumped up in annoyance and rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So why aren&rsquo;t I messed up?&rdquo; She yelled, earning a half laugh from Alex before Robert punched him in the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he isn&rsquo;t you genetic father, Mr. Cowgale killed your genetic father,&rdquo; Jasmine stated simply. Amber&rsquo;s jaw dropped and she let out a small screech of horror as her legs gave out beneath her and she crumpled to the ground. <br />
 <br />
Chapter 17</p>

<p>I woke up in my own bedroom, in my own bed and wearing my own blankets, almost as though the past few weeks hadn&rsquo;t really occurred. Of course, I remembered it all&#8230;I was determined not to forget anything, ever again so I knew my last memory before waking up in my own bed was undoubtedly me, blanking out and my legs giving out under me. Passing out seemed to have become a re-occurring event in my life, but I wasn&rsquo;t about to get used to it. <br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Sweetheart?&rdquo; My mom whispered, opening my door a crack and peaking her head in. I stared at her with a grin, taking in every inch of her long brown hair, chubby pink cheeks and big brown eyes. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; I screeched finally, leaping out of my bed and racing to give her a hug. Standing behind her, I saw Kenny standing with crossed arms and a worried expression, looking like had been crying constantly the whole time I was gone. I smiled and let go of my mom, running up to give Kenny a hug.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; He coughed in a loud voice, making me halt about a foot away from him. Without a word, Kenny turned with a frown and walked into his bedroom, slamming the door behind him and locking the door with an unmistakable click. With that, I was thrown back into reality and I turned back to my mother.</p>

<p> &ldquo;How could you not tell me? Nothing even makes sense to me anymore!&rdquo; I hollered, stalking back up to her and throwing my fist against the doorframe.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hunny, I&rsquo;m sorry, it was only to keep you safe,&rdquo; My mother cut in with a whisper. I glared at her and threw myself into my bedroom, jumping onto the bed and crying out in frustration.</p>

<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they all say!&rdquo; I yelped, watching as my mom came and rested herself down beside me. Before my mother could defend herself, I turned to her with a glare. </p>

<p> &ldquo;When did he die, How did it happen, How didn&rsquo;t you know and why, Why us mom?&rdquo; I cried, trying not to yell. My mom looked at me with sorrow and shook her head.</p>

<p> &ldquo;When you were just a baby&#8230; actually, you weren&rsquo;t even born yet.&rdquo; She said, answering my first question. There was a long pause before she continued.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Your&#8230;father&#8230;your real father, went on a business trip to Florida. It was near Valentines Day and he was only supposed to be gone a day. Then&#8230;when he didn&rsquo;t come back for two, then three weeks, and didn&rsquo;t even seem to make an effort to communicate with me. I began to worry.&rdquo; </p>

<p> I stared at her with a dropped jaw and raised my eyebrows. &ldquo;Took you a while to care,&rdquo; I commented with a frown.</p>

<p> My mom looked down in remorse and continued.</p>

<p> &ldquo;He was usually gone a little longer, and you can&rsquo;t blame him if he can&rsquo;t contact you. He worked for the government so a man's gotta do what a man&rsquo;s gotta do.&rdquo; She said simply with a shrug. She paused again before she continued.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well, I called around and a week later he was found dead, hidden in some display case at a museum. That&rsquo;s where they were having the meeting&#8230;at the museum, no one saw him after the meeting so&#8230;he was killed by a blow to the head with a mental baseball bat, although he put up a good fight&#8230;so they told me.&rdquo; A tear slowly slid down the side of my mothers face and she turned her head to the side.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well how did Romeo come in?&rdquo; I asked quickly, before she decided to be finished with her story.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well, I knew him from grade eight&#8230;I didn&rsquo;t remember him until he showed up on my doorstep with a smile and a sorry card. He said he had just moved in, and he spoke as though he were Shakespeare himself&#8230;did when he was in grade eight too, although he only every talked to the girls, and they all swooned over him.&rdquo; </p>

<p> I let out a groan of annoyance and rolled my eyes.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Anyways,&rdquo; My mother coughed in response, &ldquo;he stayed for coffee, and since he was just going to buy a hotel for the night, I offered to let him have my room, and I would have the couch. Well, he could tell I was pregnant at the time and he refused to take my bed, while I refused him to take the couch, so we just shared my bed. He borrowed a pair of your dad&rsquo;s old pajamas, and I stayed up all night, crying to him about your father&rsquo;s death, and he just hugged me and gave me condolences.&rdquo; My mom said with an almost sad sigh.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even stop to think how he knew that your father was dead. We both got a little over an hour of sleep that night and the next day, I found out he was to be my new assistant, and I was to train him. Throughout the next few weeks, he continued to stay here, and soon we fell in love and got married.&rdquo; I stared at her in horror and shook my head. </p>

<p> &ldquo;That soon after dad died?&rdquo; I yelled. My mother looked at me with anger and shook her head.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act like you&rsquo;re sad, you didn&rsquo;t even know your real father!&rdquo; She retorted defensively. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Whatever, continue,&rdquo; I snorted, rolling my eyes. It was obvious that Romeo had left better memories with my mom then with me. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Well, he was completely normal, and I didn&rsquo;t know anything way wrong until you were born. He started acting weird, at first I just thought he loved you like I loved you but he started looking at you with the same look he looked at me with. He started saying that you looked just like me&#8230; but with lust instead of love, and one day, a few weeks before your first birthday, he grabbed you from my arms with such venom that it scared me. I tried to take you back but he said in a dark tone that it was time for your bath. I started regretting ever leaving you behind with him while I went to do errands, and when he took of your dipper and dragged you, crying, to the bathroom I went out and called the cops.&rdquo;</p>

<p> My mom&rsquo;s hands began to shake as she shivered with recollection of the event.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Of course, he had locked the door so the cops had to break it down to get at you and when they did&#8230;.&rdquo; She trailed of and bit her lip between her teeth.</p>

<p> &ldquo;He ran. Changed his name, his identity, and his looks. The cops found out later that he had killed your father but it was years after he had ran and both his trials were put on hold and the cases were put at the back of their priorities pile. They decided to make me a safe house for if we needed to run but slowly I forgot everything and just when I thought all was well in the world&#8230;&rdquo; My mom stopped there and stood up, brushing off her yellow housecoat with shaking hands.</p>

<p> &ldquo;They told me not to smother you or try and protect you, and I knew they were right so I treated you like every other child. And look at you know, you grew up better than I could have expected. You&rsquo;re smart and pretty, fearless and&#8230;normal,&rdquo; She trailed off; starting to hum the song that Romeo always hummed to me, and walked out of the room. </p>

<p> I watched as my door slowly creaked shut just as Kenny stepped into the room with a grimace and freshly reddened eyes. <br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; I said with a cheery tone, trying to hide the emotions of frustration, anger and horror that threatened to overcome me.</p>

<p> &ldquo;You idiot, Next time, wherever you go, I&rsquo;m coming with you, You got it? And don&rsquo;t even think about trying to sneak away because I have my eyes on you, always. And if any guy talks to you, other then me or Robert, I will kill them.&rdquo; He growled, pacing around the room with exaggerated motions.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Did you know?&rdquo; I asked quietly. Kenny looked back at me with obvious frustration and threw his arms into the air.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Of course I knew! And our wimp mother just dragged me into hiding! I was five when this all happened but I didn&rsquo;t understand anything and now&#8230;oh now!&rdquo; Kenny turned towards the wall and slammed his fists against it. Slowly he turned back around with tears in his eyes.<br />
 &ldquo;No one will ever touch my little sister again, I love you,&rdquo; He whimpered pitifully before taking to long strides across the room and grabbing me into a bear hug. I stood shocked for a minute before wrapping my arms around him and snuggling my cheek against his chest.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Get off me you big suck,&rdquo; I laughed half-heartedly, giving him permission to let go. Instead, he hugged me tighter as more bodies surrounded me and embraced me.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ha awesome, group hug!&rdquo; I heard Alex laugh before throwing himself against the group of us and making us all tumble to the ground, still embracing. After a while, Kenny let go, followed by everyone else like a domino effect. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; I said again, now to Robert, Sara, Joel and Alex who were all now sitting around with wide grins. Robert stood up and dragged me to my feet, hugging me tightly for a second and giving me a quick kiss. </p>

<p> &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Robert mumbled in my ear, letting me go. Sara stood up and laughed.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; She repeated as both Alex and Josh stood up. Robert gave them each a menacing glare, making them back up and laugh.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I love you guys too,&rdquo; I whispered back, looking pointedly at Robert. &ldquo;I love you too&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>2 months later</p>

<p>I sat around the circular dinning room table that was in the middle of my mom&rsquo;s kitchen. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Check mate,&rdquo; Sara gloated, moving her queen across the checkerboard.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Come on, again?&rdquo; I groaned, swiping my king off the board. Robert laughed and shook his head, dragging his chair beside mine and collecting my pieces to put back on the board. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Alex! You and me baby, you and me,&rdquo; Robert taunted as Alex dragged his seat over to beside Sara and shoved her out of the way.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Easy bro,&rdquo; Sara retorted, standing up to go sit on Joel&rsquo;s lap. I laughed, watching as Alex took the first move and jumped his queen over the pawn in front of her.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Oh is this how it&rsquo;s going to be?&rdquo; Robert said, also laughing. I stood up and shuffled over to the cupboard to grab a bag of chips, looking curiously at the bottle of grape medicine sitting on the bottom shelf. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Mom, when did you buy grape medicine?&rdquo; I hollered towards the living room, shoving it aside and grabbing the ketchup chips.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Mom went shopping again,&rdquo; Kenny sighed, stalking in and grabbing the chips from my hand. I glared at him and snatched them back, watching as he reached over me and grabbed the remaining chips from the cupboard and tore them open.</p>

<p> &ldquo;She better get more chips,&rdquo; I sighed as the phone began to ring. Shrugging, I skipped to the living room and ripped the phone of the hook.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Yo, mom grab some chips,&rdquo; I blurted out, recognizing the number on the caller ID. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Hunny, I need you to tell your brother that you both need to run,&rdquo; my mother replied in a strained tone.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Is that what I told you to tell her love?&rdquo; A man huffed in the background. There was a soft rustling sound and a bang, leaving me with the sound of my mothers scream ringing in my ears.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, my flower, my love&#8230;you shouldn&rsquo;t always believe what others tell you. You&rsquo;re too easy,&rdquo; The man whispered to me in a Romanian accent, &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll find you soon enough.&rdquo; </p>

<p> I froze and the phone dropped out of my hand, bouncing on the carpet. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; I heard Kenny holler from the kitchen. I felt the blood drain out of my face as he walked into the living room with a curious expression on his face and the phone rang with the sound of the newly dead line. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Amber?&rdquo; He blurted out in a panic as my legs collapsed under me and I collapsed to the floor. I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on anymore, nor did I care, all I knew was that Jasmine either lied to me or had no idea what she was really going on. The last thing I heard was Kenny hollering at my friends who were still sitting in the kitchen, before my mind went completely numb and the room darkened to a black blur around me.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too easy,&rdquo; I whispered to Kenny, feeling his arms around me as he dragged me into his lap. </p>

<p> &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense anymore.&rdquo; My voice faded out and finally I was gone from all reality, lost in my dreams of running. Running from Romeo, running from Robert and now running from my reality. <br />
